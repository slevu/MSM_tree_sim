	abstract = {In studies of the natural history of HIV-1 infection, the time scale of primary interest is the time since infection. Unfortunately, this time is very often unknown for HIV infection and using the follow-up time instead of the time since infection is likely to provide biased results because of onset confounding. Laboratory markers such as the CD4 T-cell count carry important information concerning disease progression and can be used to predict the unknown date of infection. Previous work on this topic has made use of only one CD4 measurement or based the imputation on incident patients only. However, because of considerable intrinsic variability in CD4 levels and because incident cases are different from prevalent cases, back calculation based on only one CD4 determination per person or on characteristics of the incident sub-cohort may provide unreliable results. Therefore, we propose a methodology based on the repeated individual CD4 T-cells marker measurements that use both incident and prevalent cases to impute the unknown date of infection. Our approach uses joint modelling of the time since infection, the CD4 time path and the drop-out process. This methodology has been applied to estimate the CD4 slope and impute the unknown date of infection in HIV patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. A procedure based on the comparison of different slope estimates is proposed to assess the goodness of fit of the imputation. Results of simulation studies indicated that the imputation procedure worked well, despite the intrinsic high volatility of the CD4 marker. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Since its discovery three decades ago, the HIV epidemic has unfolded into one of the most devastating pandemics in human history. When HIV replication cannot be completely inhibited, the fast-evolving retrovirus continuously evades intra-host immune and drug selective pressure, but diversifies according to more neutral epidemiological dynamics at the interhost level. Limited evidence suggests that the virus may evolve faster in a single host than in a population of hosts, and various hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon. Here, we develop a new computational approach aimed at integrating host transmission information with pathogen genealogical reconstructions. We apply this approach to comprehensive sequence data sets sampled from a large HIV-1 subtype C transmission chain, and in addition to providing several insights into the reconstruction of HIV-1 transmissions histories and its associated population dynamics, we find that transmission decreases the HIV-1 evolutionary rate. The fact that we also identify this decline for substitutions that do not alter amino acid substitutions provides evidence against hypotheses that invoke selection forces. Instead, our findings support earlier reports that new infections start preferentially with less evolved variants, which may be stored in latently infected cells, and this may vary among different HIV-1 subtypes.},

	abstract = {Background
Phylogenetic methods produce hierarchies of molecular species, inferring knowledge about taxonomy and evolution. However, there is not yet a consensus methodology that provides a crisp partition of taxa, desirable when considering the problem of intra/inter-patient quasispecies classification or infection transmission event identification. We introduce the threshold bootstrap clustering (TBC), a new methodology for partitioning molecular sequences, that does not require a phylogenetic tree estimation.

Methodology/Principal Findings
The TBC is an incremental partition algorithm, inspired by the stochastic Chinese restaurant process, and takes advantage of resampling techniques and models of sequence evolution. TBC uses as input a multiple alignment of molecular sequences and its output is a crisp partition of the taxa into an automatically determined number of clusters. By varying initial conditions, the algorithm can produce different partitions. We describe a procedure that selects a prime partition among a set of candidate ones and calculates a measure of cluster reliability. TBC was successfully tested for the identification of type-1 human immunodeficiency and hepatitis C virus subtypes, and compared with previously established methodologies. It was also evaluated in the problem of HIV-1 intra-patient quasispecies clustering, and for transmission cluster identification, using a set of sequences from patients with known transmission event histories.

Conclusion
TBC has been shown to be effective for the subtyping of HIV and HCV, and for identifying intra-patient quasispecies. To some extent, the algorithm was able also to infer clusters corresponding to events of infection transmission. The computational complexity of TBC is quadratic in the number of taxa, lower than other established methods; in addition, TBC has been enhanced with a measure of cluster reliability. The TBC can be useful to characterise molecular quasipecies in a broad context.},

Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To apply a new method to ascertain likely place of HIV infection among persons born abroad and diagnosed with HIV in the United Kingdom (UK).
DESIGN: Analyses of heterosexual adults born abroad, diagnosed with HIV in the UK between 2004 and 2010, and reported to the national HIV diagnoses database.
METHODS: Year of infection was ascertained by applying an estimated rate of CD4 cell count decline between an individual's CD4 cell count at diagnosis and estimates of CD4-cell count at infection. A person was classified as having probably acquired HIV while living in the UK if estimated year of infection was later than reported year of arrival in the UK.
RESULTS: Of 10 612 heterosexual adults born abroad included in the analyses, 85\% (9065) were of black-African ethnicity. We estimate that 33\% (26-39\%) of persons acquired HIV while living in the UK. This percentage increased from 24\% (16-39\%) in 2004 to 46\% (31-50\%) in 2010 (P {\textless} 0.01). The estimate of 33\% is three times higher than national estimates of HIV acquired in the UK based on clinic reports (11\%) (P {\textless}  0.01).
CONCLUSION: : Assigning place of HIV infection using routinely available clinical and demographic data and estimated rates of CD4 cell decline is feasible. We report a high and increasing proportion of persons born abroad who appear to have acquired their HIV infection while living in the UK. These findings highlight the need for continued targeted HIV prevention efforts, particularly among black-African communities.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Mathematical models play an important role in our understanding of what processes drive the complex population dynamics of infectious pathogens. Yet developing statistical methods for fitting models to epidemiological data is difficult. Epidemiological data is often noisy, incomplete, aggregated across different scales and generally provides only a partial picture of the underlying disease dynamics. Using nontraditional sources of data, like molecular sequences of pathogens, can provide additional information about epidemiological dynamics. But current “phylodynamic” inference methods for fitting models to genealogies reconstructed from sequence data have a number of major limitations. We present a statistical framework that builds upon earlier work to address two of these limitations: population structure and stochasticity. By incorporating population structure, our framework can be applied in cases where the host population is divided into different subpopulations, such as by spatial isolation. Our framework also takes into consideration stochastic noise and can therefore capture the inherent variability of epidemiological dynamics. These advances allow for a much wider class of epidemiological models to be fit to genealogies in order to estimate key epidemiological parameters and to reconstruct past disease dynamics.},

We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},

Despite the historical and current importance of plague, several questions remain unanswered concerning its transmission routes and infection risk factors. The plague outbreak that started in September 1665 in the Derbyshire village of Eyam claimed 257 lives over 14 months, wiping out entire families. Since previous attempts at modelling the Eyam plague, new data have been unearthed from parish records revealing a much more complete record of the disease. Using a stochastic compartmental model and Bayesian analytical methods, we found that both rodent-to-human and human-to-human transmission played an important role in spreading the infection, and that they accounted, respectively, for a quarter and three-quarters of all infections, with a statistically significant seasonality effect. We also found that the force of infection was stronger for infectious individuals living in the same household compared with the rest of the village. Poverty significantly increased the risk of disease, whereas adulthood decreased the risk. These results on the Eyam outbreak contribute to the current debate on the relative importance of plague transmission routes.},

Although substantial advances have been made for such an integration, and they have improved our understandings of many disease dynamics which are not available otherwise, current methods have relied on fast algorithms, rather than achieving a systematic integration and accurate inference of the joint epidemiological-evolutionary process. Building on methods in current literature, this paper describes a novel Bayesian approach for systematically integrating these two streams of data. We propose a computationally tractable Bayesian inferential algorithm which takes the full joint epidemiological-evolutionary process into account. Using this algorithm, we study systematically the value of genetic data, providing valuable insights into future sampling designs. The algorithm is subsequently applied to real-world dataset describing the spread of animal foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, demonstrating the importance of such a systematic integration achieved with our methodology.},

	abstract = {We develop a new approach for estimating the undiagnosed fraction of HIV cases, the first step in the HIV Care Cascade. The goal is to address a critical blindspot in HIV prevention and treatment planning, with an approach that simplifies data requirements and can be implemented with open-source software. The primary data required is HIV testing history information on newly diagnosed cases. Two methods are presented and compared. The first is a general methodology based on simplified back-calculation that can be used to assess changes in the undiagnosed fraction over time. The second makes an assumption of constant incidence, allowing the estimate to be expressed as a simple closed formula calculation. We demonstrate the methods with an application to HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men (MSM) from Seattle/King County. The estimates suggest that 6\% of HIV-infected MSM in King County are undiagnosed, about one-third of the comparable national estimate. A sensitivity analysis on the key distributional assumption gives an upper bound of 11\%. The undiagnosed fraction varies by race/ethnicity, with estimates of 4.9\% among white, 8.6\% of African American, and 9.3\% of Hispanic HIV-infected MSM being undiagnosed.},

	abstract = {The ART of HIV prevention
Despite the relative success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for individuals infected with HIV, the rate of new diagnoses has remained fairly constant in vulnerable population groups, particularly men having sex with men (MSM). Now, ART is also available in the United States to uninfected individuals to directly prevent infection with the virus. Ratmann et al. were able to reconstruct {\textasciitilde}600 past transmission events among men having sex with men in the Netherlands, and examined probable sources of transmission. They found that the large majority of new infections is neither attributable to ineffective ART nor inadequate retention in care. Rather, many of these cases could have been averted with more comprehensive HIV testing and a broader use of ART that includes provision to uninfected men as well as starting ART as soon as possible among newly diagnosed men. These findings support making ART for pre-exposure prophylaxis available worldwide, and especially in countries with high retention in care and high ART coverage among infected MSM.
New HIV diagnoses among men having sex with men (MSM) have not decreased appreciably in most countries, even though care and prevention services have been scaled up substantially in the past 20 years. To maximize the impact of prevention strategies, it is crucial to quantify the sources of transmission at the population level. We used viral sequence and clinical patient data from one of Europe’s nationwide cohort studies to estimate probable sources of transmission for 617 recently infected MSM. Seventy-one percent of transmissions were from undiagnosed men, 6\% from men who had initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART), 1\% from men with no contact to care for at least 18 months, and 43\% from those in their first year of infection. The lack of substantial reductions in incidence among Dutch MSM is not a result of ineffective ART provision or inadequate retention in care. In counterfactual modeling scenarios, 19\% of these past cases could have been averted with current annual testing coverage and immediate ART to those testing positive. Sixty-six percent of these cases could have been averted with available antiretrovirals (immediate ART provided to all MSM testing positive, and preexposure antiretroviral prophylaxis taken by half of all who test negative for HIV), but only if half of all men at risk of transmission had tested annually. With increasing sequence coverage, molecular epidemiological analyses can be a key tool to direct HIV prevention strategies to the predominant sources of infection, and help send HIV epidemics among MSM into a decisive decline.
Available antiretrovirals both for treatment and prevention and more comprehensive HIV testing would have prevented the majority of past, annual HIV transmissions among MSM in the Netherlands, but none of the three interventions in isolation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: CD4 cell count is a key measure of HIV disease progression, and the basis of successive international guidelines for treatment initiation. CD4 cell dynamics are used in mathematical and econometric models for evaluating public health need and interventions. Here, we estimate rates of CD4 decline, stratified by relevant covariates, in a form that is clinically transparent and can be directly used in such models.
METHODS: We analyse the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in the Netherlands cohort, including individuals with date of seroconversion estimated to be within 1 year and with intensive clinical follow-up prior to treatment initiation. Owing to the fact that CD4 cell counts are intrinsically noisy, we separate the analysis into long-term trends of smoothed CD4 cell counts and an observation model relating actual CD4 measurements to the underlying smoothed counts. We use a monotonic spline smoothing model to describe the decline of smoothed CD4 cell counts through categories CD4 above 500, 350-500, 200-350 and 200 cells/μl or less. We estimate the proportion of individuals starting in each category after seroconversion and the average time spent in each category. We examine individual-level cofactors which influence these parameters.
RESULTS: Among untreated individuals, the time spent in each compartment was 3.32, 2.70, 5.50 and 5.06 years. Only 76\% started in the CD4 cell count above 500 cells/μl compartment after seroconversion. Set-point viral load (SPVL) was an important factor: individuals with at least 5 log10 copies/ml took 5.37 years to reach CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl compared with 15.76 years for SPVL less than 4 log10 copies/ml.
CONCLUSION: Many individuals already have CD4 cell count below 500 cells/μl after seroconversion. SPVL strongly influences the rate of CD4 decline. Treatment guidelines should consider measuring SPVL, whereas mathematical models should incorporate SPVL stratification.},

	abstract = {Estimates of the coalescent effective population size N(e) can be poorly correlated with the true population size. The relationship between N(e) and the population size is sensitive to the way in which birth and death rates vary over time. The problem of inference is exacerbated when the mechanisms underlying population dynamics are complex and depend on many parameters. In instances where nonparametric estimators of N(e) such as the skyline struggle to reproduce the correct demographic history, model-based estimators that can draw on prior information about population size and growth rates may be more efficient. A coalescent model is developed for a large class of populations such that the demographic history is described by a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system of arbitrary dimension. This class of demographic model differs from those typically used in population genetics. Birth and death rates are not fixed, and no assumptions are made regarding the fraction of the population sampled. Furthermore, the population may be structured in such a way that gene copies reproduce both within and across demes. For this large class of models, it is shown how to derive the rate of coalescence, as well as the likelihood of a gene genealogy with heterochronous sampling and labeled taxa, and how to simulate a coalescent tree conditional on a complex demographic history. This theoretical framework encapsulates many of the models used by ecologists and epidemiologists and should facilitate the integration of population genetics with the study of mathematical population dynamics.},

In this study, we reconstruct the related network (counting 5389 vertices and 4073 edges) and analyse its structure by means of recent developments in the field of graph theory, shedding light onto a variety of mechanisms underlying the spread of HIV and the role of contact-tracing. In particular, degree distributions, clustering/assortativity coefficients and path lengths are statistically measured. Because of the size of the graph (with a giant component of 2386 nodes and 3168 edges), basic graph representations fail to provide a clear view of the network structure. Clustering based on modularity optimization is implemented to detect community structures and obtain a better visualization and understanding of the social network, in combination with the study of the other covariates. It shows that the graph has a globally low but heterogeneous density, with some clusters of high intra-connectivity, but low inter-connectivity. Though descriptive, the results presented in this article pave the way for properly incorporating heterogeneity and structure in the dynamics of a stochastic SIR epidemic spreading on a social network.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Whole-genome sequencing is becoming popular as a tool for understanding outbreaks of communicable diseases, with phylogenetic trees being used to identify individual transmission events or to characterize outbreak-level overall transmission dynamics. Existing methods to infer transmission dynamics from sequence data rely on well-characterized infectious periods, epidemiological and clinical metadata which may not always be available, and typically require computationally intensive analysis focusing on the branch lengths in phylogenetic trees. We sought to determine whether the topological structures of phylogenetic trees contain signatures of the transmission patterns underlying an outbreak.
METHODOLOGY: We use simulated outbreaks to train and then test computational classifiers. We test the method on data from two real-world outbreaks.
RESULTS: We show that different transmission patterns result in quantitatively different phylogenetic tree shapes. We describe topological features that summarize a phylogeny's structure and find that computational classifiers based on these are capable of predicting an outbreak's transmission dynamics. The method is robust to variations in the transmission parameters and network types, and recapitulates known epidemiology of previously characterized real-world outbreaks.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: There are simple structural properties of phylogenetic trees which, when combined, can distinguish communicable disease outbreaks with a super-spreader, homogeneous transmission and chains of transmission. This is possible using genome data alone, and can be done during an outbreak. We discuss the implications for management of outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Viral phylodynamics is defined as the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viralphylogenies. Since the coining of the term in 2004, research on viral phylodynamics has focused on transmission dynamics in an effort to shed light on how these dynamics impact viral genetic variation. Transmission dynamics can be considered at the level of cells within an infected host, individual hosts within a population, or entire populations of hosts. Many viruses, especially RNA viruses, rapidly accumulate genetic variation because of short generation times and high mutation rates. Patterns of viral genetic variation are therefore heavily influenced by how quickly transmission occurs and by which entities transmit to one another. Patterns of viral genetic variation will also be affected by selection acting on viral phenotypes. Although viruses can differ with respect to many phenotypes, phylodynamic studies have to date tended to focus on a limited number of viral phenotypes. These include virulence phenotypes, phenotypes associated with viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism phenotypes, and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate escape from host immunity. Due to the impact that transmission dynamics and selection can have on viral genetic variation, viral phylogenies can therefore be used to investigate important epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes, such as epidemic spread[2], spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics[3], zoonotic transmission, tissue tropism[4], and antigenic drift[5]. The quantitative investigation of these processes through the consideration of viral phylogenies is the central aim of viral phylodynamics.},

	abstract = {Genomic data is increasingly being used to understand infectious disease epidemiology. Isolates from a given outbreak are sequenced, and the patterns of shared variation are used to infer which isolates within the outbreak are most closely related to each other. Unfortunately, the phylogenetic trees typically used to represent this variation are not directly informative about who infected whom -- a phylogenetic tree is not a transmission tree. However, a transmission tree can be inferred from a phylogeny while accounting for within-host genetic diversity by colouring the branches of a phylogeny according to which host those branches were in. Here we extend this approach and show that it can be applied to partially sampled and ongoing outbreaks. This requires computing the correct probability of an observed transmission tree and we herein demonstrate how to do this for a large class of epidemiological models. We also demonstrate how the branch colouring approach can incorporate a variable number of unique colours to represent unsampled intermediates in transmission chains. The resulting algorithm is a reversible jump Monte-Carlo Markov Chain, which we apply to both simulated data and real data from an outbreak of tuberculosis. By accounting for unsampled cases and an outbreak which may not have reached its end, our method is uniquely suited to use in a public health environment during real-time outbreak investigations.

	abstract = {Background
HIV sequence data can be used to reconstruct local transmission networks. Along international borders, like the San Diego–Tijuana region, understanding the dynamics of HIV transmission across reported risks, racial/ethnic groups, and geography can help direct effective prevention efforts on both sides of the border.
Methods
We gathered sociodemographic, geographic, clinical, and viral sequence data from HIV infected individuals participating in ten studies in the San Diego–Tijuana border region. Phylogenetic and network analysis was performed to infer putative relationships between HIV sequences. Correlates of identified clusters were evaluated and spatiotemporal relationships were explored using Bayesian phylogeographic analysis.
Findings
After quality filtering, 843 HIV sequences with associated demographic data and 263 background sequences from the region were analyzed, and 138 clusters were inferred (2–23 individuals). Overall, the rate of clustering did not differ by ethnicity, residence, or sex, but bisexuals were less likely to cluster than heterosexuals or men who have sex with men (p = 0.043), and individuals identifying as white (p ≤ 0.01) were more likely to cluster than other races. Clustering individuals were also 3.5 years younger than non-clustering individuals (p \&lt; 0.001). Although the sampled San Diego and Tijuana epidemics were phylogenetically compartmentalized, five clusters contained individuals residing on both sides of the border.
Interpretation
This study sampled {\textasciitilde} 7\% of HIV infected individuals in the border region, and although the sampled networks on each side of the border were largely separate, there was evidence of persistent bidirectional cross-border transmissions that linked risk groups, thus highlighting the importance of the border region as a “melting pot” of risk groups.

Here, we use an HIV-1 within-host coalescent model to probabilistically evaluate transmission histories of two epidemiologically linked hosts. Previous critique of phylogenetic reconstruction has claimed that direction of transmission is difficult to infer, and that the existence of unsampled intermediary links or common sources can never be excluded. The phylogenetic relationship between the HIV populations of epidemiologically linked hosts can be classified into six types of trees, based on cladistic relationships and whether the reconstruction is consistent with the true transmission history or not. We show that the direction of transmission and whether unsampled intermediary links or common sources existed make very different predictions about expected phylogenetic relationships: (i) Direction of transmission can often be established when paraphyly exists, (ii) intermediary links can be excluded when multiple lineages were transmitted, and (iii) when the sampled individuals’ HIV populations both are monophyletic a common source was likely the origin. Inconsistent results, suggesting the wrong transmission direction, were generally rare. In addition, the expected tree topology also depends on the number of transmitted lineages, the sample size, the time of the sample relative to transmission, and how fast the diversity increases after infection. Typically, 20 or more sequences per subject give robust results. We confirm our theoretical evaluations with analyses of real transmission histories and discuss how our findings should aid in interpreting phylogenetic results.},

	abstract = {Phylogenies of highly genetically variable viruses such as HIV-1 are potentially informative of epidemiological dynamics. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of clusters of highly related HIV-1 sequences, particularly among recently HIV-infected individuals, which have been used to argue for a high transmission rate during acute infection. Using a large set of HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences collected from men who have sex with men, we demonstrate that virus from recent infections tend to be phylogenetically clustered at a greater rate than virus from patients with chronic infection ('excess clustering') and also tend to cluster with other recent HIV infections rather than chronic, established infections ('excess co-clustering'), consistent with previous reports. To determine the role that a higher infectivity during acute infection may play in excess clustering and co-clustering, we developed a simple model of HIV infection that incorporates an early period of intensified transmission, and explicitly considers the dynamics of phylogenetic clusters alongside the dynamics of acute and chronic infected cases. We explored the potential for clustering statistics to be used for inference of acute stage transmission rates and found that no single statistic explains very much variance in parameters controlling acute stage transmission rates. We demonstrate that high transmission rates during the acute stage is not the main cause of excess clustering of virus from patients with early/acute infection compared to chronic infection, which may simply reflect the shorter time since transmission in acute infection. Higher transmission during acute infection can result in excess co-clustering of sequences, while the extent of clustering observed is most sensitive to the fraction of infections sampled.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12889-015-1852-9},
	abstract = {Background
Migrant populations from countries with generalised HIV epidemics make up a significant proportion of all HIV/AIDS cases in many European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries, with heterosexual transmission the predominant mode of HIV acquisition. While most of these infections are diagnosed for the first time in Europe, acquisition is believed to have predominantly occurred in the home country. A proportion of HIV transmission is believed to be occurring post-migration, and many countries may underestimate the degree to which this is occurring. Our objectives were to review the literature estimating the proportion of migrants believed to have acquired their HIV post-migration and examine which EU member states are able to provide estimates of probable country of HIV acquisition through current surveillance systems.

Methods
A systematic review was undertaken to gather evidence of sexual transmission of HIV within Europe among populations from countries with a generalised epidemic. In addition, national surveillance focal points from 30 EU/EEA Member States were asked to complete a questionnaire about surveillance methods and monitoring of the likely place of HIV acquisition among migrants.

Results \& discussion
Twenty-seven papers from seven countries were included in the review and 24 countries responded to the survey. Estimates of HIV acquisition post-migration ranged from as low as 2 \% among sub Saharan Africans in Switzerland, to 62 \% among black Caribbean men who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK. Surveillance methods for monitoring post-migration acquisition varied across the region; a range of methods are used to estimate country or region of HIV acquisition, including behavioural and clinical markers. There is little published evidence addressing this issue, although Member States highlight the importance of migrant populations in their epidemics.

Conclusions
There is post-migration HIV acquisition among migrants in European countries but this is difficult to quantify accurately with current data. Migrant MSM appear at particular risk of HIV acquisition post-migration. Countries that identify migrants as an important part of their HIV epidemic should focus on using an objective method for assigning probable country of HIV acquisition. Robust methods to measure HIV incidence should be considered in order to inform national prevention programming and resource allocation.},

	abstract = {Background
In the context of infectious disease, sequence clustering can be used to provide important insights into the dynamics of transmission. Cluster analysis is usually performed using a phylogenetic approach whereby clusters are assigned on the basis of sufficiently small genetic distances and high bootstrap support (or posterior probabilities). The computational burden involved in this phylogenetic threshold approach is a major drawback, especially when a large number of sequences are being considered. In addition, this method requires a skilled user to specify the appropriate threshold values which may vary widely depending on the application.

Results
This paper presents the Gap Procedure, a distance-based clustering algorithm for the classification of DNA sequences sampled from individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Our heuristic algorithm bypasses the need for phylogenetic reconstruction, thereby supporting the quick analysis of large genetic data sets. Moreover, this fully automated procedure relies on data-driven gaps in sorted pairwise distances to infer clusters, thus no user-specified threshold values are required. The clustering results obtained by the Gap Procedure on both real and simulated data, closely agree with those found using the threshold approach, while only requiring a fraction of the time to complete the analysis.

Conclusions
Apart from the dramatic gains in computational time, the Gap Procedure is highly effective in finding distinct groups of genetically similar sequences and obviates the need for subjective user-specified values. The clusters of genetically similar sequences returned by this procedure can be used to detect patterns in HIV-1 transmission and thereby aid in the prevention, treatment and containment of the disease.

Phylogenetic and nucleotide distance analyses were performed by using database sequences representing North American strains collected from 1978 to 1995. The estimated phylogeny was starlike, with early strains represented on different lineages. When sequences were grouped by years of collection, nucleotide distance comparisons demonstrated an increase in diversity over time and indicated that contemporary strains are more closely related to early epidemic strains than to each other. Using a recently developed likelihood ratio reduction procedure, the date of origin of the U.S. epidemic was estimated to be 1968 ± 1.4 years. A coalescent approach was also used to estimate the population history of the U.S. subtype B epidemic. Our analyses provide new information that implies an exponential growth rate from the beginning of the U.S. HIV epidemic. The dating results suggest a U.S. introduction date (or date of divergence from the most recent common ancestor) that precedes the date of the earliest known AIDS cases in the late 1970s. Furthermore, the estimated epidemic growth curve shows a period of exponential growth that preceded most of the early documented cases and also indicates a leveling of prevalence rates in the recent past.},

Methods. We analyzed a representative set of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) subtype B pol sequences from 5700 patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. We pooled these sequences with the same number of sequences from foreign epidemics, inferred a phylogeny, and identified Swiss transmission clusters as clades having a minimal size of 10 and containing ⩾80\% Swiss sequences.
Results. More than one-half of Swiss patients were included within 60 transmission clusters. Most transmission clusters were significantly dominated by specific transmission routes, which were used to identify the following patient groups: men having sex with men (MSM) (38 transmission clusters; average cluster size, 29 patients) or patients acquiring HIV through heterosexual contact (HETs) and injection drug users (IDUs) (12 transmission clusters; average cluster size, 144 patients). Interestingly, there were no transmission clusters dominated by sequences from HETs only. Although 44\% of all HETs who were infected between 1983 and 1986 clustered with injection drug users, this percentage decreased to 18\% for 2003–2006 (P {\textless} .001), indicating a diminishing role of injection drug users in transmission among HETs over time.
Conclusions. Our analysis suggests (1) the absence of a self-sustaining epidemic of HIV-1 subtype B in HETs in Switzerland and (2) a temporally decreasing clustering of HIV infections in HETs and IDUs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic was historically dominated by HIV subtype B transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). Now 50\% of diagnoses and prevalent infections are among heterosexual individuals and mainly involve non-B subtypes. Between 2002 and 2010, the prevalence of non-B diagnoses among MSM increased from 5.4\% to 17\%, and this study focused on the drivers of this change.
METHODS: Growth between 2007 and 2009 in transmission clusters among 14 000 subtype A1, C, D, and G sequences from the United Kingdom HIV Drug Resistance Database was analysed by risk group.
RESULTS: Of 1148 clusters containing at least 2 sequences in 2007, {\textgreater}75\% were pairs and {\textgreater}90\% were heterosexual. Most clusters (71.4\%) did not grow during the study period. Growth was significantly lower for small clusters and higher for clusters of ≥7 sequences, with the highest growth observed for clusters comprising sequences from MSM and people who inject drugs (PWID). Risk group (P{\textless} .0001), cluster size (P{\textless} .0001), and subtype (P{\textless} .01) were predictive of growth in a generalized linear model.
DISCUSSION: Despite the increase in non-B subtypes associated with heterosexual transmission, MSM and PWID are at risk for non-B infections. Crossover of subtype C from heterosexuals to MSM has led to the expansion of this subtype within the United Kingdom.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Despite prevention efforts new HIV diagnoses continue in the Southern US, where the epidemic is characterized by significant racial/ethnic disparities. We integrated phylogenetic analyses with clinical data to reveal trends in local HIV transmission.

Design
Cross-sectional analysis of 1671 HIV-infected individuals each with one B-subtype pol sequence obtained during chronic (82\%; UNC Center for AIDS Research Clinical Cohort) or acute/recent (18\%; Duke/UNC Acute HIV Consortium) infection.

Methods
Phylogenies were inferred using neighbor joining to select related sequences then confirmed with Bayesian methods. We characterized transmission clusters (clades n≥3 sequences supported by posterior probabilities=1) by factors including race/ethnicity and transmission risk. Factors associated with cluster membership were evaluated for newly diagnosed patients.

Results
Overall, 72\% were male, 59\% black and 39\% MSM. A total of 557 (33\%) sequences grouped in either 108 pairs (n=216) or 67 clusters (n=341). Clusters ranged from 3–36 (median 4) members. Composition was delineated primarily by race, with 28\% exclusively black, and to a lesser extent by risk group. Both MSM and heterosexuals formed discrete clusters though substantial mixing was observed. In multivariable analysis, patients with age ≤30 years (P=0.009), acute infection (P=0.02), local residence (P=0.002), and transmitted drug resistance (P=0.02) were more likely to be cluster members while Latinos were less likely (P{\textless}0.001).

Conclusions
Integration of molecular, clinical and demographic data offers a unique view into the structure of local transmission networks. Clustering by black race, youth and TDR and inability to identify Latino clusters will inform prevention, testing and linkage to care strategies.},

	abstract = {Objective   To estimate HIV incidence and highlight the characteristics of persons at greatest risk of HIV in the Ukraine capital, Kiev.       Method   Residual samples from newly-diagnosed persons attending the Kiev City AIDS Centre were tested for evidence of recent HIV infection using an avidity assay. Questions on possible risk factors for HIV acquisition and testing history were introduced. All persons (≥16yrs) presenting for an HIV test April’13–March’14 were included. Rates per 100,000 population were calculated using region-specific denominators.       Results   During the study period 6370 individuals tested for HIV. Of the 467 individuals newly-diagnosed with HIV, 21 had insufficient samples for LAg testing. Of the remaining 446, 39 (8.7\%) were classified as recent with an avidity index \&lt;1.5ODn, 10 were reclassified as long-standing as their viral load was \&lt;1000 copies/mL, resulting in 29 (6.5\%) recent HIV infections. The only independent predictor for a recent infection was probable route of exposure, with MSM more likely to present with a recent infection compared with heterosexual contact [Odds Ratio 8.86; 95\%CI 2.65–29.60]. We estimated HIV incidence at 21.5 per 100,000 population, corresponding to 466 new infections. Using population estimates for MSM and PWID, incidence was estimated to be between 2289.6 and 6868.7/100,000 MSM, and 350.4 for PWID.       Conclusion   A high proportion of persons newly-infected remain undiagnosed, with MSM disproportionally affected with one in four newly-HIV-diagnosed and one in three recently-HIV-infected.

When there are missing data in Y, the distribution of Y given  in all cluster members (“complete clusters”) may be different from the distribution just in members with observed Y (“observed clusters”). Often the former is of interest, but when data are missing because in a fundamental sense Y does not exist (e.g., quality of life for a person who has died), the latter may be more meaningful (quality of life conditional on being alive). Weighted and doubly weighted generalized estimating equations and shared random-effects models have been proposed for observed-cluster inference when cluster size is informative, that is, the distribution of Y given  in observed clusters depends on observed cluster size. We show these methods can be seen as actually giving inference for complete clusters and may not also give observed-cluster inference. This is true even if observed clusters are complete in themselves rather than being the observed part of larger complete clusters: here methods may describe imaginary complete clusters rather than the observed clusters. We show under which conditions shared random-effects models proposed for observed-cluster inference do actually describe members with observed Y. A psoriatic arthritis dataset is used to illustrate the danger of misinterpreting estimates from shared random-effects models.},

Use of laboratory biomarkers that distinguish recent from longstanding infection to quantify HIV incidence rely on having accurate knowledge of the average time that individuals spend in a transient state of recent infection between seroconversion and reaching a specified biomarker cutoff value. This paper describes five estimation procedures from two general statistical approaches, a survival time approach and an approach that fits binomial models of the probability of being classified as recently infected, as a function of time since seroconversion. We compare these procedures for estimating the mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) for two biomarkers used by the U.S. National HIV Surveillance System for determination of HIV incidence, the Aware BED EIA HIV-1 incidence test (BED) and the avidity-based, modified Bio-Rad HIV-1/HIV-2 plus O ELISA (BRAI) assay. Collectively, 953 specimens from 220 HIV-1 subtype B seroconverters, taken from 5 cohorts, were tested with a biomarker assay. Estimates of MDRI using the non-parametric survival approach were 198.4 days (SD 13.0) for BED and 239.6 days (SD 13.9) for BRAI using cutoff values of 0.8 normalized optical density and 30\%, respectively. The probability of remaining in the recent state as a function of time since seroconversion, based upon this revised statistical approach, can be applied in the calculation of annual incidence in the United States.},

	abstract = {Identifying and monitoring HIV clusters could be useful in tracking the leading edge of HIV transmission in epidemics. Currently, greater specificity in the definition of HIV clusters is needed to reduce confusion in the interpretation of HIV clustering results. We address sampling density as one of the key aspects of HIV cluster analysis. The proportion of viral sequences in clusters was estimated at sampling densities from 1.0\% to 70\%. A set of 1,248 HIV-1C env gp120 V1C5 sequences from a single community in Botswana was utilized in simulation studies. Matching numbers of HIV-1C V1C5 sequences from the LANL HIV Database were used as comparators. HIV clusters were identified by phylogenetic inference under bootstrapped maximum likelihood and pairwise distance cut-offs. Sampling density below 10\% was associated with stochastic HIV clustering with broad confidence intervals. HIV clustering increased linearly at sampling density {\textgreater}10\%, and was accompanied by narrowing confidence intervals. Patterns of HIV clustering were similar at bootstrap thresholds 0.7 to 1.0, but the extent of HIV clustering decreased with higher bootstrap thresholds. The origin of sampling (local concentrated vs. scattered global) had a substantial impact on HIV clustering at sampling densities ≥10\%. Pairwise distances at 10\% were estimated as a threshold for cluster analysis of HIV-1 V1C5 sequences. The node bootstrap support distribution provided additional evidence for 10\% sampling density as the threshold for HIV cluster analysis. The detectability of HIV clusters is substantially affected by sampling density. A minimal genotyping density of 10\% and sampling density of 50-70\% are suggested for HIV-1 V1C5 cluster analysis.},

	abstract = {Over calendar time, HIV-1 evolves considerably faster within individuals than it does at the epidemic level. This is a surprising observation since, from basic population genetic theory, we would expect the genetic substitution rate to be similar across different levels of biological organization. Three different mechanisms could potentially cause the observed mismatch in phylogenetic rates of divergence: temporal changes in selection pressure during the course of infection; frequent reversion of adaptive mutations after transmission; and the storage of the virus in the body followed by the preferential transmission of stored ancestral virus. We evaluate each of these mechanisms to determine whether they are likely to make a major contribution to the mismatch in phylogenetic rates. We conclude that the cycling of the virus through very long-lived memory CD4+ T cells, a process that we call ‘store and retrieve’, is probably the major contributing factor to the rate mismatch. The preferential transmission of ancestral virus needs to be integrated into evolutionary models if we are to accurately predict the evolution of immune escape, drug resistance and virulence in HIV-1 at the population level. Moreover, early infection viruses should be the major target for vaccine design, because these are the viral strains primarily involved in transmission.},

	abstract = {Exploiting pathogen genomes to reconstruct transmission represents a powerful tool in the fight against infectious disease. However, their interpretation rests on a number of simplifying assumptions that regularly ignore important complexities of real data, in particular within-host evolution and non-sampled patients. Here we propose a new approach to transmission inference called SCOTTI (Structured COalescent Transmission Tree Inference). This method is based on a statistical framework that models each host as a distinct population, and transmissions between hosts as migration events. Our computationally efficient implementation of this model enables the inference of host-to-host transmission while accommodating within-host evolution and non-sampled hosts. SCOTTI is distributed as an open source package for the phylogenetic software BEAST2. We show that SCOTTI can generally infer transmission events even in the presence of considerable within-host variation, can account for the uncertainty associated with the possible presence of non-sampled hosts, and can efficiently use data from multiple samples of the same host, although there is some reduction in accuracy when samples are collected very close to the infection time. We illustrate the features of our approach by investigating transmission from genetic and epidemiological data in a Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) veterinary outbreak in England and a Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak in a Nepali neonatal unit. Transmission histories inferred with SCOTTI will be important in devising effective measures to prevent and halt transmission.},

	abstract = {Author Summary   Recent work has attempted to use whole-genome sequence data from pathogens to reconstruct the transmission trees linking infectors and infectees in outbreaks. However, transmission trees from one outbreak do not generalize to future outbreaks. Reconstruction of transmission trees is most useful to public health if it leads to generalizable scientific insights about disease transmission. Accurate estimates of transmission parameters can help identify risk factors for transmission and aid the design and evaluation of public health interventions for emerging infections. Using statistical methods for time-to-event data (survival analysis), estimation of transmission parameters is based on sums or averages over the possible transmission trees. By providing partial information about who infected whom, a pathogen phylogeny can reduce the set of possible transmission trees and increase the precision of transmission parameter estimates. We derive algorithms that enumerate the transmission trees consistent with a pathogen phylogeny and epidemiologic data, show how to calculate likelihoods for transmission data with a phylogeny, and apply these methods to a foot and mouth disease outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001. These methods will allow pathogen genetic sequences to be incorporated into the analysis of outbreak investigations, vaccine trials, and other studies of infectious disease transmission.},

METHODS: Estimates of diagnosed PLWH in New York City (NYC) and other 19 jurisdictions based on HIV case reporting were compared with those based on HIV laboratory reporting. A revised HIV care continuum was constructed based on previously published data.
RESULTS: The estimate of PLWH based on HIV case reporting was 25.6\% higher than that based on HIV laboratory reporting data in NYC. There were 819,200 PLWH in the United States at the end of 2011 (plausible range: 809,800, 828,800), of whom 86\% were diagnosed, 72\% retained in care (≥1 care visit in 2011), 68\% on antiretroviral therapy, and 55\% virally suppressed (≤200 copies/mL).
CONCLUSIONS: The current method based on HIV case reporting may have overestimated PLWH in the United States. While we continue cleaning HIV case reporting data to improve its quality, we should take the opportunity to use comprehensive HIV laboratory reporting data to estimate PLWH at both the national and local level.},

	abstract = {Analyses of viral genetic linkage can provide insight into HIV transmission dynamics and the impact of prevention interventions. For example, such analyses have the potential to determine whether recently-infected individuals have acquired viruses circulating within or outside a given community. In addition, they have the potential to identify characteristics of chronically infected individuals that make their viruses likely to cluster with others circulating within a community. Such clustering can be related to the potential of such individuals to contribute to the spread of the virus, either directly through transmission to their partners or indirectly through further spread of HIV from those partners. Assessment of the extent to which individual (incident or prevalent) viruses are clustered within a community will be biased if only a subset of subjects are observed, especially if that subset is not representative of the entire HIV infected population. To address this concern, we develop a multiple imputation framework in which missing sequences are imputed based on a model for the diversification of viral genomes. The imputation method decreases the bias in clustering that arises from informative missingness. Data from a household survey conducted in a village in Botswana are used to illustrate these methods. We demonstrate that the multiple imputation approach reduces bias in the overall proportion of clustering due to the presence of missing observations.},

Studies of these HIV-1 variants provide critical information about the transmission bottlenecks and the selective pressures acting on the virus in the transmission fluid and in the recipient tissues. These studies reveal that T/F virus phenotypes are shaped by stochastic and selective forces that restrict transmission and may be targets for prevention strategies. In this Review, we highlight how studies of T/F viruses contribute to a better understanding of the biology of HIV-1 transmission and discuss how these findings affect HIV-1 prevention strategies.

	abstract = {The control, prediction, and understanding of epidemiological processes require insight into how infectious pathogens transmit in a population. The chain of transmission can in principle be reconstructed with phylogenetic methods which analyze the evolutionary history using pathogen sequence data. The quality of the reconstruction, however, crucially depends on the underlying epidemiological model used in phylogenetic inference. Until now, only simple epidemiological models have been used, which make limiting assumptions such as constant rate parameters, infinite total population size, or deterministically changing population size of infected individuals. Here, we present a novel phylogenetic method to infer parameters based on a classical stochastic epidemiological model. Specifically, we use the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, which accounts for density-dependent transmission rates and finite total population size, leading to a stochastically changing infected population size. We first validate our method by estimating epidemic parameters for simulated data and then apply it to transmission clusters from the Swiss HIV epidemic. Our estimates of the basic reproductive number R0 for the considered Swiss HIV transmission clusters are significantly higher than previous estimates, which were derived assuming infinite population size. This difference in key parameter estimates highlights the importance of careful model choice when doing phylogenetic inference. In summary, this article presents the first fully stochastic implementation of a classical epidemiological model for phylogenetic inference and thereby addresses a key aspect in ongoing efforts to merge phylogenetics and epidemiology.},

	abstract = {The human displacement and sexual behavior are the main factors driving the HIV-1 pandemic to the current profile. The intrinsic structure of the HIV transmission among different individuals has valuable importance for the understanding of the epidemic and for the public health response. The aim of this study was to characterize the HIV-1 subtype B (HIV-1B) epidemic in South America through the identification of transmission links and infer trends about geographical patterns and median time of transmission between individuals. Sequences of the protease and reverse transcriptase coding regions from 4,810 individuals were selected from GenBank. Maximum likelihood phylogenies were inferred and submitted to ClusterPicker to identify transmission links. Bayesian analyses were applied only for clusters including ≥5 dated samples in order to estimate the median maximum inter-transmission interval. This study analyzed sequences sampled from 12 South American countries, from individuals of different exposure categories, under different antiretroviral profiles, and from a wide period of time (1989–2013). Continentally, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela were revealed important sites for the spread of HIV-1B among countries inside South America. Of note, from all the clusters identified about 70\% of the HIV-1B infections are primarily occurring among individuals living in the same geographic region. In addition, these transmissions seem to occur early after the infection of an individual, taking in average 2.39 years (95\% CI 1.48–3.30) to succeed. Homosexual/Bisexual individuals transmit the virus as quickly as almost half time of that estimated for the general population sampled here. Public health services can be broadly benefitted from this kind of information whether to focus on specific programs of response to the epidemic whether as guiding of prevention campaigns to specific risk groups.},

Phylodynamic inference attempts to reverse this flow of information, estimating parameters of these processes from the shape of a virus phylogeny reconstructed from a sample of genetic sequences from the epidemic. A key challenge to phylodynamic inference is quantifying the similarity between two trees in an efficient and comprehensive way. In this study, I demonstrate that a new distance measure, based on a subset tree kernel function from computational linguistics, confers a significant improvement over previous measures of tree shape for classifying trees generated under different epidemiological scenarios. Next, I incorporate this kernel-based distance measure into an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework for phylodynamic inference. ABC bypasses the need for an analytical solution of model likelihood, as it only requires the ability to simulate data from the model. I validate this “kernel-ABC” method for phylodynamic inference by estimating parameters from data simulated under a simple epidemiological model. Results indicate that kernel-ABC attained greater accuracy for parameters associated with virus transmission than leading software on the same data sets. Finally, I apply the kernel-ABC framework to study a recent outbreak of a recombinant HIV subtype in China. Kernel-ABC provides a versatile framework for phylodynamic inference because it can fit a broader range of models than methods that rely on the computation of exact likelihoods.},

	abstract = {Background. Clinically, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pol sequences are used to evaluate for drug resistance. These data can also be used to evaluate transmission networks and help describe factors associated with transmission risk.
Methods. HIV-1 pol sequences from participants at 5 sites in the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort from 2000–2009 were analyzed for genetic relatedness. Only the first available sequence per participant was included. Inferred transmission networks (“clusters”) were defined as ≥2 sequences with ≤1.5\% genetic distance. Clusters including ≥3 patients (“networks”) were evaluated for clinical and demographic associations.
Results. Of 3697 sequences, 24\% fell into inferred clusters: 155 clusters of 2 individuals (“dyads”), 54 clusters that included 3–14 individuals (“networks”), and 1 large cluster that included 336 individuals across all study sites. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with being in a cluster included not using antiretroviral (ARV) drugs at time of sampling (P {\textless} .001), sequence collected after 2004 (P {\textless} .001), CD4 cell count {\textgreater}350 cells/mL (P {\textless} .01), and viral load 10 000–100 000 copies/mL (P {\textless} .001) or {\textgreater}100 000 copies/mL (P {\textless} .001). In networks, women were more likely to cluster with other women (P {\textless} .001), and African Americans with other African Americans (P {\textless} .001).
Conclusions. Molecular epidemiology can be applied to study HIV transmission networks in geographically and demographically diverse cohorts. Clustering was associated with lack of ARV use and higher viral load, implying transmission may be interrupted by earlier diagnosis and treatment. Observed female and African American networks reinforce the importance of diagnosis and prevention efforts targeted by sex and race.},

A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

To unveil the molecular clock of HIV-1 we analyzed a unique set of viruses from a known transmission history with separation times between samples of up to 25 years. The env V3 and p17gag regions of the genome were sequenced, and genetic distances were estimated by using the true tree and a nucleotide substitution model based on a general reversible Markov process with a gamma distribution to account for differences in substitution rates among sites. Linear regression analysis showed that separation times were significantly correlated with synonymous as well as nonsynonymous nucleotide distances in both V3 and p17, giving strong support for the existence of a molecular clock. The estimated rate of nucleotide substitution was 6.7 ± 2.1 × 10−3 substitutions/site per year in V3 and 2.7 ± 0.5 × 10−3 in p17. Importantly, the regression analyses showed that there was a significant genetic distance at zero divergence times. This pretransmission interval exists because the ramifications in the phylogenetic trees do not correspond to time of transmission, but rather to the coalescence time of the most recent common ancestor of the viruses carried by the transmitter and the recipient. Simulation experiments showed that neither the V3 nor the p17 clocks were overdispersed, which indicates that the introduction of nucleotide substitutions can be described adequately by a simple stochastic Poisson process.},

	abstract = {The constant rate birth–death process is used as a stochastic model for many biological systems, for example phylogenies or disease transmission. As the biological data are usually not fully available, it is crucial to understand the effect of incomplete sampling. In this paper, we analyze the constant rate birth–death process with incomplete sampling. We derive the density of the bifurcation events for trees on n leaves which evolved under this birth–death-sampling process. This density is used for calculating prior distributions in Bayesian inference programs and for efficiently simulating trees. We show that the birth–death-sampling process can be interpreted as a birth–death process with reduced rates and complete sampling. This shows that joint inference of birth rate, death rate and sampling probability is not possible. The birth–death-sampling process is compared to the sampling-based population genetics model, the coalescent. It is shown that despite many similarities between these two models, the distribution of bifurcation times remains different even in the case of very large population sizes. We illustrate these findings on an Hepatitis C virus dataset from Egypt. We show that the transmission times estimates are significantly different—the widely used Gamma statistic even changes its sign from negative to positive when switching from the coalescent to the birth–death process.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
HIV evolves rapidly and therefore infections with similar genetic sequences are likely linked by recent transmission events. Clusters of related infections can represent subpopulations with high rates of transmission. We describe the implementation of an automated near real-time system to monitor and characterise HIV transmission hotspots in British Columbia, Canada.
Methods
In this implementation case study, we applied a monitoring system to the British Columbia drug treatment database, which holds more than 32 000 anonymised HIV genotypes for nearly 9000 residents of British Columbia living with HIV. On average, five to six new HIV genotypes are deposited in the database every day, which triggers an automated reanalysis of the entire database. We extracted clusters of five or more individuals with short phylogenetic distances between their respective HIV sequences. The system generated monthly reports of the growth and characteristics of clusters that were distributed to public health officers.
Findings
In June, 2014, the monitoring system detected the expansion of a cluster by 11 new cases during 3 months, including eight cases with transmitted drug resistance. This cluster generally comprised young men who have sex with men. The subsequent report precipitated an enhanced public health follow-up to ensure linkage to care and treatment initiation in the affected subpopulation. Of the nine cases associated with this follow-up, all had already been linked to care and five cases had started treatment. Subsequent to the follow-up, three additional cases started treatment and most cases achieved suppressed viral loads. During the next 12 months, we detected 12 new cases in this cluster with reduction in the onward transmission of drug resistance.
Interpretation
Our findings show the first application of an automated phylogenetic system monitoring a clinical database to detect a recent HIV outbreak and support the ensuing public health response. By making secondary use of routinely collected HIV genotypes, this approach is cost-effective, attains near real-time monitoring of new cases, and can be implemented in all settings in which HIV genotyping is the standard of care.

	abstract = {Background: HIV transmission in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK has shown no sign of decreasing in the past decade. Additional prevention measures are needed. We aimed to estimate the effect of various potential interventions implemented individually and in combination on prevention of HIV infection. Methods: We extended a deterministic partnership-based mathematical model for HIV transmission, informed by detailed behavioural and surveillance data, to assess the effect of seven different HIV interventions implemented in MSM (aged 15-64 years) in the UK during 2014-20, including increasing rates of HIV testing, test-and-treat programmes, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and sexual behavioural changes. We did sensitivity analyses on risk compensation. Findings: We predicted a baseline of 16 955 new infections (IQR 13 156-21 669) in MSM in the UK during 2014-20. At a coverage of ≤50\%, testing twice a year outperformed all other interventions. Of all intervention combinations, only the combined effect of test and treat and annual HIV testing (61·8\%, IQR 47·2-81·8, of total incidence) was greater than the sum of effects of the two interventions individually (32·6\%, 23·7-46·0, and 23·9\%, 16·5-33·3, respectively). Simultaneous PrEP, expansion of HIV testing, and initiation of test-and-treat programme in 25\% of high-activity MSM could save 7399 (IQR 5587-9813) UK MSM from HIV infection (43·6\%, IQR 32·9-57·9, of total incidence). An increase in unsafe sex or sexual partners to 50\% or more could substantially reduce the effect of interventions, but is unlikely to negate the prevention benefit completely. Interpretation: PrEP could prevent a large number of new HIV infections if other key strategies including HIV testing and treatment are simultaneously expanded and improved. Without PrEP, HIV incidence in MSM in the UK is unlikely to decrease substantially by the end of this decade. Funding: Health Protection Agency (now Public Health England). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1097/QAD.0000000000001209},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Assays for classifying HIV infections as 'recent' or 'non-recent' for incidence surveillance fail to simultaneously achieve large mean durations of 'recent' infection (MDRIs) and low 'false-recent' rates (FRRs), particularly in virally suppressed persons. The potential for optimizing recent infection testing algorithms (RITAs), by introducing viral load criteria and tuning thresholds used to dichotomize quantitative measures, is explored.
DESIGN: The Consortium for the Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays characterized over 2000 possible RITAs constructed from seven assays (LAg, BED, Less-sensitive Vitros, Vitros Avidity, BioRad Avidity, Architect Avidity and Geenius) applied to 2500 diverse specimens.
METHODS: MDRIs were estimated using regression, and FRRs as observed 'recent' proportions, in various specimen sets. Context-specific FRRs were estimated for hypothetical scenarios. FRRs were made directly comparable by constructing RITAs with the same MDRI through the tuning of thresholds. RITA utility was summarized by the precision of incidence estimation.
RESULTS: All assays produce high FRRs amongst treated subjects and elite controllers (10\%-80\%). Viral load testing reduces FRRs, but diminishes MDRIs. Context-specific FRRs vary substantially by scenario - BioRad Avidity and LAg provided the lowest FRRs and highest incidence precision in scenarios considered.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of a low viral load threshold provides crucial improvements in RITAs. However, it does not eliminate non-zero FRRs, and MDRIs must be consistently estimated. The tuning of thresholds is essential for comparing and optimizing the use of assays. The translation of directly measured FRRs into context-specific FRRs critically affects their magnitudes and our understanding of the utility of assays.},

	abstract = {Calculus is one of the triumphs of the human mind. It emerged from inv- tigations into such basic questions as ?nding areas, lengths and volumes. In the third century B. C. , Archimedes determined the area under the arc of a parabola. In the early seventeenth century, Fermat and Descartes studied the problem of ?nding tangents to curves. But the subject really came to life in the hands of Newton and Leibniz in the late seventeenth century. In part- ular, they showed that the geometric problems of ?nding the areas of planar regions and of ?nding the tangents to plane curves are intimately related to one another. In subsequent decades, the subject developed further through the work of several mathematicians, most notably Euler, Cauchy, Riemann, and Weierstrass. Today,calculus occupies a centralplacein mathematics and is an essential component of undergraduate education. It has an immense number of app- cations both within and outside mathematics. Judged by the sheer variety of the concepts and results it has generated, calculus can be rightly viewed as a fountainhead of ideas and disciplines in mathematics. Real analysis, often called mathematical analysis or simply analysis, may be regarded as a formidable counterpart of calculus. It is a subject where one revisits notionsencountered in calculus, but with greaterrigor and sometimes with greater generality. Nonetheless, the basic objects of study remain the same, namely, real-valued functions of one or several real variables.

A transmission network score (TNS) was developed to estimate the risk of HIV transmission from a newly diagnosed individual to a new partner and target prevention interventions. Results HIV-1 pol sequences from 339 individuals (52.3\%) were highly similar to sequences from at least one other participant (i.e., clustered). A high TNS (top 25\%) was significantly correlated with baseline risk behaviors (number of unique sexual partners and insertive unprotected anal intercourse (p = 0.014 and p = 0.0455, respectively) and predicted risk of transmission (p{\textless}0.0001). Retrospective analysis of antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, and simulations of ART targeted to individuals with the highest TNS, showed significantly reduced network level HIV transmission (p{\textless}0.05). Conclusions Sequence data from an HIV-1 screening program focused on recently infected persons and their social and sexual contacts enabled the characterization of a highly connected transmission network. The network-based risk score (TNS) was highly correlated with transmission risk behaviors and outcomes, and can be used identify and target effective prevention interventions, like ART, to those at a greater risk for HIV-1 transmission.},

METHODS: A total of 22,481 HIV-1 subtype B pol gene sequences sampled between 1996 and 2008 were analysed. Dated phylogenies were reconstructed and transmission clusters identified as clades of at least two sequences with a maximum genetic distance of 4.5\%, a branch support of at least 95\% and spanning 5 years. The characteristics of clusters containing at least one heterosexually acquired infection were analysed.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of the linked heterosexuals clustered exclusively with MSM. These were more likely to be men than women. Estimated misclassification of homosexually acquired infections ranged between 1 and 11\% of the reported male heterosexuals diagnosed with HIV. Black African heterosexual men were more often phylogenetically linked to MSM than other ethnic group, with an estimated misclassification range between 1 and 21\%.
CONCLUSION: Overall, a small proportion of self-reported heterosexual men diagnosed with HIV could have been infected homosexually. However, up to one in five black African heterosexual men chose not to disclose sex with men at HIV diagnosis and preferred to be identified as heterosexual. Phylogenetic analyses can enhance surveillance-based risk information and inform national programmes for monitoring and preventing HIV infections.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine how HIV-1 risk groups impact transmitted diversity and the tempo of viral evolution at a population scale.
METHODS: We investigated a set of previously described transmission chains (n = 70) using a population genetic approach, and tested whether the expected differences in proportions of multivariant transmissions are reflected by varying proportions of transmitted diversity between men having sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual (HET) subpopulations - the largest contributors to HIV spread. To assess evolutionary rate differences among the different risk groups, we compiled risk group datasets for subtypes A1, B and CRF01\_AE, and directly compared the absolute substitution rate and its synonymous and non-synonymous components.
RESULTS: There was sufficient demographic signal to inform the transmission model in Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees using env data to compare the transmission bottleneck size between the MSM and HET risk groups. We found no indications for a different proportion of transmitted genetic diversity at the population level between these groups. In the direct rate comparisons between the risk groups, however, we consistently recovered a higher evolutionary rate in the male-dominated risk group compared to the HET datasets.
CONCLUSION: We find that the risk group composition affects the viral evolutionary rate and therefore potentially also the adaptation rate. In particular, risk group-specific sex ratios, and the variation in within-host evolutionary rates between men and women, impose evolutionary rate differences at the epidemic level, but we cannot exclude a role of varying transmission rates.},

	abstract = {Transmission lies at the interface of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution within and among hosts and separates distinct selective pressures that impose differences in both the mode of diversification and the tempo of evolution. In the absence of comprehensive direct comparative analyses of the evolutionary processes at different biological scales, our understanding of how fast within-host HIV-1 evolutionary rates translate to lower rates at the between host level remains incomplete. Here, we address this by analyzing pol and env data from a large HIV-1 subtype C transmission chain for which both the timing and the direction is known for most transmission events. To this purpose, we develop a new transmission model in a Bayesian genealogical inference framework and demonstrate how to constrain the viral evolutionary history to be compatible with the transmission history while simultaneously inferring the within-host evolutionary and population dynamics. We show that accommodating a transmission bottleneck affords the best fit our data, but the sparse within-host HIV-1 sampling prevents accurate quantification of the concomitant loss in genetic diversity. We draw inference under the transmission model to estimate HIV-1 evolutionary rates among epidemiologically-related patients and demonstrate that they lie in between fast intra-host rates and lower rates among epidemiologically unrelated individuals infected with HIV subtype C. Using a new molecular clock approach, we quantify and find support for a lower evolutionary rate along branches that accommodate a transmission event or branches that represent the entire backbone of transmitted lineages in our transmission history. Finally, we recover the rate differences at the different biological scales for both synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates, which is only compatible with the 'store and retrieve' hypothesis positing that viruses stored early in latently infected cells preferentially transmit or establish new infections upon reactivation.},

METHODS: For HIV-1 pol sequences reported to the U.S. National HIV Surveillance System during 2001-2012, we calculated pairwise genetic distance, identified linked pairs of sequences (those with distance ≤1.5\%), and examined transmission category and race/ethnicity of these potential transmission partners.
RESULTS: Of 40,950 sequences, 12,910 (32\%) linked to ≥1 other sequence. Of men who have sex with men (MSM) who linked to ≥1 sequence, 88\% were linked to other MSM and only 4\% were linked to heterosexual women. Of heterosexual women for whom we identified potential transmission partners, 29\% linked to MSM, 21\% to heterosexual men, and 12\% to persons who inject drugs. Older and black MSM were more likely to be linked to heterosexual women. Assortative mixing was present for all racial/ethnic groups; 81\% of blacks/African Americans linked to other blacks.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis is the first use of U.S. surveillance data to infer an HIV transmission network. Our data suggest that HIV infections among heterosexual women predominantly originate from MSM, followed by heterosexual men. Although few MSM were linked to women, suggesting that a minority of MSM are involved in transmission with heterosexual women, these transmissions represent a substantial proportion of HIV acquisitions by heterosexual women. Interventions that reduce transmissions involving MSM are likely to also reduce HIV acquisition among other risk groups.},

To address this disparity, we examined the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolutionary rate on the population level for IDU and heterosexual transmissions. All available HIV-1 env V3 sequences from IDU outbreaks and heterosexual epidemics with known sampling dates were collected from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database. Evolutionary rates were calculated using phylogenetic trees with a t test root optimization of dated samples. The evolutionary rate of HIV-1 subtype A1 was found to be 8.4 times lower in fast spread among IDUs in the former Soviet Union (FSU) than in slow spread among heterosexual individuals in Africa. Mixed epidemics (IDU and heterosexual) showed intermediate evolutionary rates, indicating a combination of fast- and slow-spread patterns. Hence, if transmissions occur repeatedly during the initial stage of host infection, before selective pressures of the immune system have much impact, the rate of HIV-1 evolution on the population level will decrease. Conversely, in slow spread, where HIV-1 evolves under the pressure of the immune system before a donor infects a recipient, the virus evolution at the population level will increase. Epidemiological modeling confirmed that the evolutionary rate of HIV-1 depends on the rate of spread and predicted that the HIV-1 evolutionary rate in a fast-spreading epidemic, e.g., for IDUs in the FSU, will increase as the population becomes saturated with infections and the virus starts to spread to other risk groups.},

	abstract = {Linkage analysis is useful in investigating disease transmission dynamics and the effect of interventions on them, but estimates of probabilities of linkage between infected people from observed data can be biased downward when missingness is informative. We investigate variation in the rates at which subjects' viral genotypes link across groups defined by viral load (low/high) and antiretroviral treatment (ART) status using blood samples from household surveys in the Northeast sector of Mochudi, Botswana. The probability of obtaining a sequence from a sample varies with viral load; samples with low viral load are harder to amplify. Pairwise genetic distances were estimated from aligned nucleotide sequences of HIV-1C env gp120. It is first shown that the probability that randomly selected sequences are linked can be estimated consistently from observed data. This is then used to develop estimates of the probability that a sequence from one group links to at least one sequence from another group under the assumption of independence across pairs. Furthermore, a resampling approach is developed that accounts for the presence of correlation across pairs, with diagnostics for assessing the reliability of the method. Sequences were obtained for 65\% of subjects with high viral load (HVL, n = 117), 54\% of subjects with low viral load but not on ART (LVL, n = 180), and 45\% of subjects on ART (ART, n = 126). The probability of linkage between two individuals is highest if both have HVL, and lowest if one has LVL and the other has LVL or is on ART. Linkage across groups is high for HVL and lower for LVL and ART. Adjustment for missing data increases the group-wise linkage rates by 40–100\%, and changes the relative rates between groups. Bias in inferences regarding HIV viral linkage that arise from differential ability to genotype samples can be reduced by appropriate methods for accommodating missing data., The analysis of viral genomes has great potential for investigating transmission of disease, including the identification of risk factors and transmission clusters, and can thereby aid in targeting interventions. To make use of genetic data in this way, it is necessary to make inferences about population-level patterns of viral linkage. As with any rigorous statistical inference from sampled data to a population, it is important to consider the effect of the sampling strategy and the occurrence of missing data on the final inferences made. In this paper we highlight the effects of missing data on the resulting estimates of population level linkage rates and develop methods for adjusting for the presence of missing data. As an example, we consider comparing the rates of linkage of HIV sequences from subjects with high viral load, low viral load, or on antiretroviral treatment, and show that comparative inferences are compromised when adjustment is not made for missing sequences and bias in inferences can be reduced with proper adjustment.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
Control of HIV transmission could be achievable through an expansion of HIV testing of at-risk populations together with ready access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. To examine whether increases in testing rates and antiretroviral therapy coverage correspond to the control of HIV transmission, we estimated HIV incidence in men who have sex with men (MSM) in England and Wales since 2001.
Methods
A CD4-staged back-calculation model of HIV incidence was used to disentangle the competing contributions of time-varying rates of diagnosis and HIV incidence to observed HIV diagnoses. Estimated trends in time to diagnosis, incidence, and undiagnosed infection in MSM were interpreted against a backdrop of increased HIV testing rates and antiretroviral-therapy coverage over the period 2001–10.
Findings
The observed 3·7 fold expansion in HIV testing in MSM was mirrored by a decline in the estimated mean time-to-diagnosis interval from 4·0 years (95\% credible interval [CrI] 3·8–4·2) in 2001 to 3·2 years (2·6–3·8) by the end of 2010. However, neither HIV incidence (2300–2500 annual infections) nor the number of undiagnosed HIV infections (7370, 95\% CrI 6990–7800, in 2001, and 7690, 5460–10 580, in 2010) changed throughout the decade, despite an increase in antiretroviral uptake from 69\% in 2001 to 80\% in 2010.
Interpretation
CD4 cell counts at HIV diagnosis are fundamental to the production of robust estimates of incidence based on HIV diagnosis data. Improved frequency and targeting of HIV testing, as well as the introduction of ART at higher CD4 counts than is currently recommended, could begin a decline in HIV transmission among MSM in England and Wales.

METHODS: We developed a multi-state back-calculation model to estimate HIV incidence, time between infection and diagnosis, and the undiagnosed population by CD4 count strata, using surveillance data on new HIV and AIDS diagnoses. The HIV incidence curve was modelled using cubic splines. The model was tested on simulated data and applied to surveillance data on men who have sex with men in The Netherlands.
RESULTS: The number of HIV infections could be estimated accurately using simulated data, with most values within the 95\% confidence intervals of model predictions. When applying the model to Dutch surveillance data, 15,400 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 15,000, 16,000) men who have sex with men were estimated to have been infected between 1980 and 2011. HIV incidence showed a bimodal distribution, with peaks around 1985 and 2005 and a decline in recent years. Mean time to diagnosis was 6.1 (95\% CI = 5.8, 6.4) years between 1984 and 1995 and decreased to 2.6 (2.3, 3.0) years in 2011. By the end of 2011, 11,500 (11,000, 12,000) men who have sex with men in The Netherlands were estimated to be living with HIV, of whom 1,750 (1,450, 2,200) were still undiagnosed. Of the undiagnosed men who have sex with men, 29\% (22, 37) were infected for less than 1 year, and 16\% (13, 20) for more than 5 years.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In some countries, HIV surveillance is based on case-reporting of newly diagnosed infections. We present a new back-projection method for estimating HIV-incidence trends using individuals' CD4 cell counts at diagnosis.
METHODS: On the basis of a review of CD4 cell count distributions among HIV-uninfected people, CD4 cell count following primary infection, and rates of CD4 cell count decline over time among people with HIV, we simulate the expected distribution in time between infection and diagnosis. Applying this to all diagnosed individuals provides a distribution of likely infection times and estimates for population incidence, level of undiagnosed HIV, and the average time from infection to diagnosis each year. We applied this method to the national HIV case surveillance data of Australia for 1983-2013.
RESULTS: The estimated number of new HIV infections in Australia in 2013 was 912 (95\% uncertainty bound 835-1002). We estimate that 2280 (95\% uncertainty bound 1900-2830) people were living with undiagnosed HIV at the end of 2013, corresponding to approximately 9.4\% (95\% uncertainty bound 7.8-10.1\%) of all people living with HIV. With increases in the average CD4 count at diagnosis, the inferred HIV testing rate has been increasing over time and the estimated mean and median times between infection and diagnosis have decreased substantially. However, the estimated mean time between infection and diagnosis is considerably greater than the median, indicating that some people remain undiagnosed for long periods. Differences were found between cases attributable to male homosexual exposure versus other cases.
CONCLUSION: This methodology provides a novel way of estimating population incidence by combining diagnosis dates and CD4 cell counts at diagnosis.},

	abstract = {We describe epidemiological trends in HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United Kingdom (UK) to inform prevention strategies. National HIV surveillance data were analysed for trends. Multivariable analyses identified predictors of late diagnosis ({\textless}350 copies/µL) and mortality. Between 1999 and 2013, 37,560 MSM (≥15 years) were diagnosed with HIV in the UK. New diagnoses rose annually from 1,440 in 1999 to 3,250 in 2013. The majority of MSM were of white ethnicity (85\%) and UK-born (68\%). Median CD4 count increased steadily from 350 cells/µL to 463 cells/µL. HIV testing in England increased from 10,900 tests in 1999 to 102,600 in 2013. One-year death rates after diagnosis declined among late presenters (4.7\% to 1.9\%). Despite declining late diagnosis (50\% to 31\%), the number of men diagnosed late annually has remained high since 2004. Older age (≥50 years), and living outside London were predictors of late presentation; older age and late presentation were predictors of one-year mortality. Increases in new diagnoses reflect increased testing and ongoing transmission. Over 900 men present late each year and mortality in this group remains high and preventable. Appropriate prevention and testing strategies require strengthening to reduce HIV transmission and late diagnosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased rates of testing, with early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, represent a key potential HIV-prevention approach. Currently, in MSM in the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 36\% are diagnosed by 1 year from infection, and the ART initiation threshold is at CD4 cell count 350/μl. We investigated what would be required to reduce HIV incidence in MSM to below 1 per 1000 person-years (i.e. {\textless}535 new infections per year) by 2030, and whether this is likely to be cost-effective.
METHODS: A dynamic, individual-based simulation model was calibrated to multiple data sources on HIV in MSM in the United Kingdom. Outcomes were projected according to future alternative HIV testing and ART initiation scenarios to 2030, considering also potential changes in levels of condomless sex.
RESULTS: For ART use to result in an incidence of close to 1/1000 person-years requires the proportion of all HIV-positive MSM with viral suppression to increase from below 60\% currently to 90\%, assuming no rise in levels of condomless sex. Substantial increases in HIV testing, such that over 90\% of men are diagnosed within a year of infection, would increase the proportion of HIV-positive men with viral suppression to 80\%, and it would be 90\%, if ART is initiated at diagnosis. The scenarios required for such a policy to be cost-effective are presented.
CONCLUSION: This analysis provides targets for the proportion of all HIV-positive MSM with viral suppression required to achieve substantial reductions in HIV incidence.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00056-2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomised placebo-controlled trials have shown that daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir-emtricitabine reduces the risk of HIV infection. However, this benefit could be counteracted by risk compensation in users of PrEP. We did the PROUD study to assess this effect.
METHODS: PROUD is an open-label randomised trial done at 13 sexual health clinics in England. We enrolled HIV-negative gay and other men who have sex with men who had had anal intercourse without a condom in the previous 90 days. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (245 mg) and emtricitabine (200 mg) either immediately or after a deferral period of 1 year. Randomisation was done via web-based access to a central computer-generated list with variable block sizes (stratified by clinical site). Follow-up was quarterly. The primary outcomes for the pilot phase were time to accrue 500 participants and retention; secondary outcomes included incident HIV infection during the deferral period, safety, adherence, and risk compensation. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (number ISRCTN94465371) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02065986).
FINDINGS: We enrolled 544 participants (275 in the immediate group, 269 in the deferred group) between Nov 29, 2012, and April 30, 2014. Based on early evidence of effectiveness, the trial steering committee recommended on Oct 13, 2014, that all deferred participants be offered PrEP. Follow-up for HIV incidence was complete for 243 (94\%) of 259 patient-years in the immediate group versus 222 (90\%) of 245 patient-years in the deferred group. Three HIV infections occurred in the immediate group (1·2/100 person-years) versus 20 in the deferred group (9·0/100 person-years) despite 174 prescriptions of post-exposure prophylaxis in the deferred group (relative reduction 86\%, 90\% CI 64-96, p=0·0001; absolute difference 7·8/100 person-years, 90\% CI 4·3-11·3). 13 men (90\% CI 9-23) in a similar population would need access to 1 year of PrEP to avert one HIV infection. We recorded no serious adverse drug reactions; 28 adverse events, most commonly nausea, headache, and arthralgia, resulted in interruption of PrEp. We detected no difference in the occurrence of sexually transmitted infections, including rectal gonorrhoea and chlamydia, between groups, despite a suggestion of risk compensation among some PrEP recipients.
INTERPRETATION: In this high incidence population, daily tenofovir-emtricitabine conferred even higher protection against HIV than in placebo-controlled trials, refuting concerns that effectiveness would be less in a real-world setting. There was no evidence of an increase in other sexually transmitted infections. Our findings strongly support the addition of PrEP to the standard of prevention for men who have sex with men at risk of HIV infection.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is interest in expanding ART to prevent HIV transmission, but in the group with the highest levels of ART use, men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM), numbers of new infections diagnosed each year have not decreased as ARTcoverage has increased for reasons which remain unclear.
METHODS: We analysed data on the HIV-epidemic in MSM in the UK from a range of sources using an individual-based simulation model. Model runs using parameter sets found to result in good model fit were used to infer changes in HIV-incidence and risk behaviour.
RESULTS: HIV-incidence has increased (estimated mean incidence 0.30/100 person-years 1990-1997, 0.45/100 py 1998-2010), associated with a modest (26\%) rise in condomless sex. We also explored counter-factual scenarios: had ART not been introduced, but the rise in condomless sex had still occurred, then incidence 2006-2010 was 68\% higher; a policy of ART initiation in all diagnosed with HIV from 2001 resulted in 32\% lower incidence; had levels of HIV testing been higher (68\% tested/year instead of 25\%) incidence was 25\% lower; a combination of higher testing and ART at diagnosis resulted in 62\% lower incidence; cessation of all condom use in 2000 resulted in a 424\% increase in incidence. In 2010, we estimate that undiagnosed men, the majority in primary infection, accounted for 82\% of new infections.
CONCLUSION: A rise in HIV-incidence has occurred in MSM in the UK despite an only modest increase in levels of condomless sex and high coverage of ART. ART has almost certainly exerted a limiting effect on incidence. Much higher rates of HIV testing combined with initiation of ART at diagnosis would be likely to lead to substantial reductions in HIV incidence. Increased condom use should be promoted to avoid the erosion of the benefits of ART and to prevent other serious sexually transmitted infections.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: HIV is a major public health problem among MSM in the United Kingdom with around 2400 new infections annually. We quantified the contribution of biological and behavioural factors.
DESIGN: Modelling study.
METHODS: A partnership-based model of HIV transmission among UK MSM aged 15-64 years was developed and calibrated to time series HIV prevalence. The calibration was validated using multiple surveillance datasets. Population-attributable fractions were used to estimate the contribution of behavioural and biological factors to HIV transmission over the period 2001-2002, 2014-2015, and 2019-2020.
RESULTS: The contribution of most biological and behavioural factors was relatively constant over time, with the key group sustaining HIV transmission being higher-sexual activity MSM aged below 35 years living with undiagnosed HIV. The effect of primary HIV infection was relatively small with 2014-2015 population-attributable fraction of 10\% (3-28\%) in comparison with other subsequent asymptomatic stages. Diagnosed men who were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) currently contributed 26\% (14-39\%) of net infections, whereas ART-treated MSM accounted for 17\% (10-24\%). A considerable number of new infections are also likely to occur within long-term relationships.
CONCLUSION: The majority of the new HIV infections among MSM in the United Kingdom during 2001-2020 is expected to be accounted for by a small group of younger and highly sexually active individuals, living with undiagnosed HIV in the asymptomatic stage. Bringing this group into HIV/AIDS care by improving testing uptake is a vital step for preventing onward transmission and will determine the success of using ART as prevention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies of sexual behavior have shown that individuals vary greatly in their number of sexual partners over time, but it has proved difficult to obtain parameter estimates relating to the dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission except in small-scale contact tracing studies. Recent developments in molecular phylodynamics have provided new routes to obtain these parameter estimates, and current clinical practice provides suitable data for entire infected populations.
METHODS: A phylodynamic analysis was performed on partial pol gene sequences obtained for routine clinical care from 14,560 individuals, representing approximately 60\% of the HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) under care in the United Kingdom.
RESULTS: Among individuals linked to others in the data set, 29\% are linked to only 1 individual, 41\% are linked to 2-10 individuals, and 29\% are linked to ≥10 individuals. The right-skewed degree distribution can be approximated by a power law, but the data are best fitted by a Waring distribution for all time depths. For time depths of 5-7 years, the distribution parameter ρ lies within the range that indicates infinite variance.
CONCLUSIONS: The transmission network among UK MSM is characterized by preferential association such that a randomly distributed intervention would not be expected to stop the epidemic.},

	abstract = {The heterosexual risk group has become the largest HIV infected group in the United Kingdom during the last 10 years, but little is known of the network structure and dynamics of viral transmission in this group. The overwhelming majority of UK heterosexual infections are of non-B HIV subtypes, indicating viruses originating among immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa. The high rate of HIV evolution, combined with the availability of a very high density sample of viral sequences from routine clinical care has allowed the phylodynamics of the epidemic to be investigated for the first time. Sequences of the viral protease and partial reverse transcriptase coding regions from 11,071 patients infected with HIV of non-B subtypes were studied. Of these, 2774 were closely linked to at least one other sequence by nucleotide distance. Including the closest sequences from the global HIV database identified 296 individuals that were in UK-based groups of 3 or more individuals. There were a total of 8 UK-based clusters of 10 or more, comprising 143/2774 (5\%) individuals, much lower than the figure of 25\% obtained earlier for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sample dates were incorporated into relaxed clock phylogenetic analyses to estimate the dates of internal nodes. From the resulting time-resolved phylogenies, the internode lengths, used as estimates of maximum transmission intervals, had a median of 27 months overall, over twice as long as obtained for MSM (14 months), with only 2\% of transmissions occurring in the first 6 months after infection. This phylodynamic analysis of non-B subtype HIV sequences representing over 40\% of the estimated UK HIV-infected heterosexual population has revealed heterosexual HIV transmission in the UK is clustered, but on average in smaller groups and is transmitted with slower dynamics than among MSM. More effective intervention to restrict the epidemic may therefore be feasible, given effective diagnosis programmes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The structure of sexual contact networks plays a key role in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections, and their reconstruction from interview data has provided valuable insights into the spread of infection. For HIV, the long period of infectivity has made the interpretation of contact networks more difficult, and major discrepancies have been observed between the contact network and the transmission network revealed by viral phylogenetics. The high rate of HIV evolution in principle allows for detailed reconstruction of links between virus from different individuals, but often sampling has been too sparse to describe the structure of the transmission network. The aim of this study was to analyze a high-density sample of an HIV-infected population using recently developed techniques in phylogenetics to infer the short-term dynamics of the epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Sequences of the protease and reverse transcriptase coding regions from 2,126 patients, predominantly MSM, from London were compared: 402 of these showed a close match to at least one other subtype B sequence. Nine large clusters were identified on the basis of genetic distance; all were confirmed by Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) phylogenetic analysis. Overall, 25\% of individuals with a close match with one sequence are linked to 10 or more others. Dated phylogenies of the clusters using a relaxed clock indicated that 65\% of the transmissions within clusters took place between 1995 and 2000, and 25\% occurred within 6 mo after infection. The likelihood that not all members of the clusters have been identified renders the latter observation conservative.
CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction of the HIV transmission network using a dated phylogeny approach has revealed the HIV epidemic among MSM in London to have been episodic, with evidence of multiple clusters of transmissions dating to the late 1990s, a period when HIV prevalence is known to have doubled in this population. The quantitative description of the transmission dynamics among MSM will be important for parameterization of epidemiological models and in designing intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Phylogenetics is frequently used for studies of population-based HIV transmission. The purpose of this review is to highlight the current utilities and limitations of phylogenetics in HIV epidemiological research from sample collection through to data analysis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of HIV phylogenies can provide critical information about HIV epidemics that are otherwise difficult to obtain through traditional study design such as transmission of drug-resistant virus, mixing between demographic groups, and rapidity of viral spread within populations. However, recent results from empirical and theoretical studies of HIV phylogenies challenge some of the key assumptions and interpretations from phylogenetic studies. Recent findings include lack of transmission bottlenecks in MSM and injection drug use epidemics, evidence for preferential transmission of HIV virus in heterosexual epidemics, and limited evidence that tree topologies correlate directly with underlying network structures. Other challenges include a lack of a standardized definition for a phylogenetic transmission cluster and biased or sparse sampling of HIV transmission networks.
SUMMARY: Phylogenetics is an important tool for HIV research, and offers opportunities to understand critical aspects of the HIV epidemic. Like all epidemiological research, the methods used and interpretation of results from phylogenetic studies should be made cautiously with careful consideration.},

	abstract = {Understanding the determinants of virus transmission is a fundamental step for effective design of screening and intervention strategies to control viral epidemics. Phylogenetic analysis can be a valid approach for the identification of transmission chains, and very-large data sets can be analysed through parallel computation. Here we propose and validate a new methodology for the partition of large-scale phylogenies and the inference of transmission clusters. This approach, on the basis of a depth-first search algorithm, conjugates the evaluation of node reliability, tree topology and patristic distance analysis. The method has been applied to identify transmission clusters of a phylogeny of 11,541 human immunodeficiency virus-1 subtype B pol gene sequences from a large Italian cohort. Molecular transmission chains were characterized by means of different clinical/demographic factors, such as the interaction between male homosexuals and male heterosexuals. Our method takes an advantage of a flexible notion of transmission cluster and can become a general framework to analyse other epidemics.},

	abstract = {Southern Africa continues to be the epicenter of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This HIV-1 subtype C epidemic has a predominantly heterosexual mode of virus transmission and high (\&gt;15\%) HIV prevalence among adults. The epidemiological dynamics of the HIV-1C epidemic in southern Africa are still poorly understood. Here, we aim at a better understanding of HIV transmission dynamics by analyzing HIV-1 subtype C sequences from Mochudi, a peri-urban village in Botswana.

HIV-1C env gene sequences (gp120 V1C5) were obtained through enhanced household-based HIV testing and counseling in Mochudi. More than 1200 sequences were generated and phylogenetically distinct sub-epidemics within Mochudi identified. The Bayesian birth-death skyline plot was used to estimate the effective reproductive number, R, and the timing of virus transmission, to classify sub-epidemics as “acute” (those with recent viral transmissions) or “historic” (those without recent viral transmissions).

We identified two of the 15 sub-epidemics as “acute.” The median estimates of R among the clusters ranged from 0.72 to 1.77. The majority of HIV lineages, 11 out of 15 clusters with 5+ members, appear to have been introduced to Mochudi between 1996 and 2002. The median peak duration of viral transmissions was 7.1 years (range 2.9–9.7 years). The median life span of identified HIV sub-epidemics, i.e., the time between the inferred epidemic origin and its most recent sample, was 13.1 years (range 10.2–22.1 years). Most viral transmissions within the sub-epidemics occurred between 1997 and 2007. The time period during which infected people are infectious appears to have decreased since the introduction of the national ART program in Botswana.

Real-time HIV genotyping and breaking down local HIV epidemics into phylogenetically distinct sub-epidemics may help to reveal the structure and dynamics of HIV transmission networks in communities, and aid in the design of targeted interventions for members of the acute sub-epidemics that likely fuel local HIV/AIDS epidemics.},

Here we present a novel Bayesian approach to reconstruct densely sampled outbreaks from genomic data while considering within-host diversity. We infer a time-labeled phylogeny using Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST), and then infer a transmission network via a Monte Carlo Markov chain. We find that under a realistic model of within-host evolution, reconstructions of simulated outbreaks contain substantial uncertainty even when genomic data reflect a high substitution rate. Reconstruction of a real-world tuberculosis outbreak displayed similar uncertainty, although the correct source case and several clusters of epidemiologically linked cases were identified. We conclude that genomics cannot wholly replace traditional epidemiology but that Bayesian reconstructions derived from sequence data may form a useful starting point for a genomic epidemiology investigation.},

	abstract = {Identifying the source of transmission using pathogen genetic data is complicated by numerous biological, immunological, and behavioral factors. A large source of error arises when there is incomplete or sparse sampling of cases. Unsampled cases may act as either a common source of infection or as an intermediary in a transmission chain for hosts infected with genetically similar pathogens. It is difficult to quantify the probability of common source or intermediate transmission events, which has made it difficult to develop statistical tests to either confirm or deny putative transmission pairs with genetic data. We present a method to incorporate additional information about an infectious disease epidemic, such as incidence and prevalence of infection over time, to inform estimates of the probability that one sampled host is the direct source of infection of another host in a pathogen gene genealogy. These methods enable forensic applications, such as source-case attribution, for infectious disease epidemics with incomplete sampling, which is usually the case for high-morbidity community-acquired pathogens like HIV, Influenza and Dengue virus. These methods also enable epidemiological applications such as the identification of factors that increase the risk of transmission. We demonstrate these methods in the context of the HIV epidemic in Detroit, Michigan, and we evaluate the suitability of current sequence databases for forensic and epidemiological investigations. We find that currently available sequences collected for drug resistance testing of HIV are unlikely to be useful in most forensic investigations, but are useful for identifying transmission risk factors., Molecular data from pathogens may be useful for identifying the source of infection and identifying pairs of individuals such that one host transmitted to the other. Inference of who acquired infection from whom is confounded by incomplete sampling, and given genetic data only, it is not possible to infer the direction of transmission in a transmission pair. Given additional information about an infectious disease epidemic, such as incidence of infection over time, and the proportion of hosts sampled, it is possible to correct for biases stemming from incomplete sampling of the infected host population. It may even be possible to infer the direction of transmission within a transmission pair if additional clinical, behavioral, and demographic covariates of the infected hosts are available. We consider the problem of identifying the source of infection using HIV sequence data collected for clinical purposes. We find that it is rarely possible to infer transmission pairs with high credibility, but such data may nevertheless be useful for epidemiological investigations and identifying risk factors for transmission.},

The phylogenetic methods commonly used for this purpose can be misleading if the substitution model makes incorrect assumptions about the data. Empirical studies consider a pool of models and select that with the highest statistical fit. However, this does not allow the rejection of all models, even if they poorly describe the data. An alternative is to use model adequacy methods that evaluate the ability of a model to predict hypothetical future observations. This can be done by comparing the empirical data with data generated under the model in question. We conducted simulations to evaluate the sensitivity of such methods with nucleotide, amino acid, and codon data. These effectively detected underparameterized models, but failed to detect mutational saturation and some instances of nonstationary base composition, which can lead to biases in estimates of tree topology and length. To test the applicability of these methods with real data, we analyzed nucleotide and amino acid data sets from the genus Flavivirus of RNA viruses. In most cases these models were inadequate, with the exception of a data set of relatively closely related sequences of Dengue virus, for which the GTR+Γ nucleotide and LG+Γ amino acid substitution models were adequate. Our results partly explain the lack of consensus over estimates of the long-term evolutionary time scale of these viruses, and indicate that assessing the adequacy of substitution models should be routinely used to determine whether estimates are reliable.},

	abstract = {Molecular clock models are commonly used to estimate evolutionary rates and timescales from nucleotide sequences. The goal of these models is to account for rate variation among lineages, such that they are assumed to be adequate descriptions of the processes that generated the data. A common approach for selecting a clock model for a data set of interest is to examine a set of candidates and to select the model that provides the best statistical fit. However, this can lead to unreliable estimates if all the candidate models are actually inadequate. For this reason, a method of evaluating absolute model performance is critical. We describe a method that uses posterior predictive simulations to assess the adequacy of clock models. We test the power of this approach using simulated data and find that the method is sensitive to bias in the estimates of branch lengths, which tends to occur when using underparameterized clock models. We also compare the performance of the multinomial test statistic, originally developed to assess the adequacy of substitution models, but find that it has low power in identifying the adequacy of clock models. We illustrate the performance of our method using empirical data sets from coronaviruses, simian immunodeficiency virus, killer whales, and marine turtles. Our results indicate that methods of investigating model adequacy, including the one proposed here, should be routinely used in combination with traditional model selection in evolutionary studies. This will reveal whether a broader range of clock models to be considered in phylogenetic analysis.},

	abstract = {Introduction In England, 80\% of HIV diagnoses are in sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics. Since 2009, Public Health England offered testing for recent HIV infection.
Aim To estimate HIV incidence among STI clinic attendees in 2012.
Methods The AxSYM avidity assay, modified to determine antibody avidity, was conducted on aliquots of newly diagnosed persons and results linked to the national HIV database. An incident case was defined as avidity {\textless}0.8, no antiretroviral treatment or AIDS and viral load ≥400 copies/mL at diagnosis. The number of persons tested for HIV was assessed using the Genitourinary Medicine Clinic Activity Dataset. We estimated and adjusted for a 1.9\% (95\% C.I. 1.0\%–3.4\%) false recent rate and used 202 days as the mean duration of recent infection to calculate incidence rates.
Results Of 212 STI clinics in England, 150(71\%) submitted specimens for recent infection testing, comprising 3,930 persons newly diagnosed; 50\% were MSM. The number of HIV tests/diagnosis was 210 for all clinic attendees, 38 for MSM, 403 for all heterosexuals and 46 for black African heterosexuals. HIV incidence was 0.15\% (95\% C.I. 0.13–0.18\%) for all attendees, 1.22\% (95\% C.I. 1.07–1.42\%) for MSM, 1.41\% (95\% C.I. 1.21\%-1.66\%) for MSM in London, 0.03\% (95\% C.I. 0.02–0.04\%) for heterosexuals and 0.13\% (0.05–0.22\%) for black African heterosexuals.
Discussion/conclusion Testing for recent HIV infection combined with routinely collected clinical data provides robust and timely national estimates of HIV incidence. HIV incidence among MSM and black African heterosexuals attending STI clinics was 40 and nine times higher respectively than among all heterosexuals, and exceeds the WHO-defined elimination threshold of 0.1\%.},

The method of rooting the tree was responsible for most of the sequence variation both among the reconstructed ancestral sequences and between the ancestral and observed sequences. Variation in predicted 3-D structural properties of the ancestors mirrored their sequence variation. The observed sequence consensus and ancestral sequences from center-rooted trees were most similar in all predicted attributes. Only for the predicted number of N-glycosylation sites was there a difference between MP and ML methods of reconstruction. Taxon sampling effects were observed only for outgroup-rooted trees, not center-rooted, reflecting the occurrence of several divergent basal sequences. Thus, for sequences exhibiting a radial phylogenetic tree, as does HIV-1, most of the variation in the estimated ancestor arises from the method of rooting the phylogenetic tree. Those investigating the ancestors of genes exhibiting such a radial tree should pay particular attention to alternate rooting methods in order to obtain a representative sample of ancestors.},

Using HIV-1 as an example of a model evolutionary system, we consider how population structure affects the shape and the structure of a viral phylogeny in the absence of strong selection at the population level. For structured populations, the number of lineages as a function of time is insufficient to describe the shape of the phylogeny. We develop deterministic approximations for the dynamics of tips of the phylogeny over evolutionary time, the number of ‘cherries’, tips that share a direct common ancestor, and Sackin's index, a commonly used measure of phylogenetic imbalance or asymmetry. We employ cherries both as a measure of asymmetry of the tree as well as a measure of the association between sequences from different groups. We consider heterogeneity in infectiousness associated with different stages of HIV infection, and in contact rates between groups of individuals. In the absence of selection, we find that population structure may have relatively little impact on the overall asymmetry of a tree, especially when only a small fraction of infected individuals is sampled, but may have marked effects on how sequences from different subpopulations cluster and co-cluster.},

	abstract = {Phylogenies provide a useful way to understand the evolutionary history of genetic samples, and data sets with more than a thousand taxa are becoming increasingly common, notably with viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Dating ancestral events is one of the first, essential goals with such data. However, current sophisticated probabilistic approaches struggle to handle data sets of this size. Here, we present very fast dating algorithms, based on a Gaussian model closely related to the Langley-Fitch molecular-clock model. We show that this model is robust to uncorrelated violations of the molecular clock. Our algorithms apply to serial data, where the tips of the tree have been sampled through times. They estimate the substitution rate and the dates of all ancestral nodes. When the input tree is unrooted, they can provide an estimate for the root position, thus representing a new, practical alternative to the standard rooting methods (e.g., midpoint). Our algorithms exploit the tree (recursive) structure of the problem at hand, and the close relationships between least-squares and linear algebra. We distinguish between an unconstrained setting and the case where the temporal precedence constraint (i.e., an ancestral node must be older that its daughter nodes) is accounted for. With rooted trees, the former is solved using linear algebra in linear computing time (i.e., proportional to the number of taxa), while the resolution of the latter, constrained setting, is based on an active-set method that runs in nearly linear time. With unrooted trees the computing time becomes (nearly) quadratic (i.e., proportional to the square of the number of taxa). In all cases, very large input trees ({\textgreater}10,000 taxa) can easily be processed and transformed into time-scaled trees. We compare these algorithms to standard methods (root-to-tip, r8s version of Langley-Fitch method, and BEAST). Using simulated data, we show that their estimation accuracy is similar to that of the most sophisticated methods, while their computing time is much faster. We apply these algorithms on a large data set comprising 1194 strains of Influenza virus from the pdm09 H1N1 Human pandemic.

	abstract = {Gene sequences sampled at different points in time can be used to infer molecular phylogenies on a natural timescale of months or years, provided that the sequences in question undergo measurable amounts of evolutionary change between sampling times. Data sets with this property are termed heterochronous and have become increasingly common in several fields of biology, most notably the molecular epidemiology of rapidly evolving viruses. Here we introduce the cross-platform software tool, TempEst (formerly known as Path-O-Gen), for the visualization and analysis of temporally sampled sequence data. Given a molecular phylogeny and the dates of sampling for each sequence, TempEst uses an interactive regression approach to explore the association between genetic divergence through time and sampling dates. TempEst can be used to (1) assess whether there is sufficient temporal signal in the data to proceed with phylogenetic molecular clock analysis, and (2) identify sequences whose genetic divergence and sampling date are incongruent. Examination of the latter can help identify data quality problems, including errors in data annotation, sample contamination, sequence recombination, or alignment error. We recommend that all users of the molecular clock models implemented in BEAST first check their data using TempEst prior to analysis.},

	abstract = {Molecular dating has become central to placing a temporal dimension on the tree of life. Methods for estimating divergence times have been developed for over 50 years, beginning with the proposal of molecular clock in 1962. We categorize the chronological development of these methods into four generations based on the timing of their origin. In the first generation approaches (1960s–1980s), a strict molecular clock was assumed to date divergences. In the second generation approaches (1990s), the equality of evolutionary rates between species was first tested and then a strict molecular clock applied to estimate divergence times. The third generation approaches (since ∼2000) account for differences in evolutionary rates across the tree by using a statistical model, obviating the need to assume a clock or to test the equality of evolutionary rates among species. Bayesian methods in the third generation require a specific or uniform prior on the speciation-process and enable the inclusion of uncertainty in clock calibrations. The fourth generation approaches (since 2012) allow rates to vary from branch to branch, but do not need prior selection of a statistical model to describe the rate variation or the specification of speciation model. With high accuracy, comparable to Bayesian approaches, and speeds that are orders of magnitude faster, fourth generation methods are able to produce reliable timetrees of thousands of species using genome scale data. We found that early time estimates from second generation studies are similar to those of third and fourth generation studies, indicating that methodological advances have not fundamentally altered the timetree of life, but rather have facilitated time estimation by enabling the inclusion of more species. Nonetheless, we feel an urgent need for testing the accuracy and precision of third and fourth generation methods, including their robustness to misspecification of priors in the analysis of large phylogenies and data sets.},

The development of relaxed molecular clocks, which model variable substitution rates among lineages, was intended to rectify this problem. Major subtypes of pandemic HIV-1 group M are thought to exemplify closely related lineages with different substitution rates. Here, we report that inferring the time of most recent common ancestor of all these subtypes in a single phylogeny under a single (relaxed) molecular clock produces significantly different dates for many of the subtypes than does analysis of each subtype on its own. We explore various methods to ameliorate this problem. We conclude that current molecular dating methods are inadequate for dealing with this type of substitution rate variation in HIV-1.

	abstract = {Background
HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) represent viral recombinant lineages that play a significant role in the global epidemic. Two of them dominate the epidemic in Burkina Faso: CRF06\_cpx (first described in this country) and CRF02\_AG. We reconstructed the phylodynamics of both recombinant viruses in Burkina Faso and throughout West Africa.
Methods
We analysed CRF06\_cpx and CRF02\_AG sequences (protease/gp41) from early samples collected in Burkina Faso in 1986 together with other GenBank sequences (1984–2013) in 4 datasets: African CRF06\_cpx (210/60); down-sampled CRF06\_cpx (146/45); Burkina Faso CRF02\_AG (130/39) and West/Central African CRF02\_AG (691/298). For each dataset, we analysed both protease and gp41 jointly using the BEAST multilocus analysis and conducted phylogeographic analysis to reconstruct the early migration routes between countries.
Results
The time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of CRF06\_cpx was 1979 (1973–1983) for protease and 1981 (1978–1983) for gp41. The gp41 analysis inferred the origin of CRF06\_cpx (or at least its parental subtype G lineage) in the Democratic Republic of Congo but migrated to Burkina Faso soon after (1982). Both genes showed that CRF06\_cpx radiated to the rest of West Africa predominantly after around 1990. These results were robust to the oversampling of Burkina Faso sequences as they were confirmed in the down-sampled dataset. The tMRCA of the Burkina Faso CRF02\_AG lineage was 1979 (1977–1983) for protease and 1980 (1978–1981) for gp41. However, we reconstructed its presence in West Africa much earlier (mid-1960s), with an initial origin in Cameroon and/or Nigeria, and its phylogeographic analysis revealed much interconnection within the region with a lack of country-specific phylogenetic patterns, which prevents tracking its exact migration routes.
Conclusions
Burkina Faso presents a relatively young HIV epidemic, with the diversification of the current in-country CRF02\_AG and CRF06\_cpx lineages taking place around 1980. This country represents the main source of CRF06\_cpx in West Africa. The CRF02\_AG epidemic started at least a decade earlier and showed much interchange between West African countries (especially involving coastal countries) suggesting great population mobility and an extensive viral spread in the region.},

However, little is known about differences in evolutionary rate between different subtypes. In this study, we collected representative samples of the main epidemic subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), namely, sub-subtype A1, subtypes B, C, D, and G, and CRFs 01\_AE and 02\_AG. We analyzed separate data sets for pol and env. We performed a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo relaxed-clock phylogenetic analysis and applied a codon model to the resulting phylogenetic trees to estimate nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) rates along each and every branch. We found important differences in the evolutionary rates of the different subtypes. These are due to differences not only in the dN rate but also in the dS rate, varying in roughly similar ways, indicating that these differences are caused by both different selective pressures (for dN rate) and the replication dynamics (for dS rate) (i.e., mutation rate or generation time) of the strains. CRF02\_AG and subtype G had higher rates, while subtype D had lower dN and dS rates than the other subtypes. The dN/dS ratio estimates were also different, especially for the env gene, with subtype G showing the lowest dN/dS ratio of all subtypes.},

We call this procedure multiple outputation, as all “excess” data within each cluster is thrown out multiple times. Hoffman, Sen, and Weinberg (2001, Biometrika88, 1121–1134) introduced this approach for generalized linear models when the cluster size is related to outcome. In this article, we demonstrate the broad applicability of the approach. Applications to angular data, p-values, vector parameters, Bayesian inference, genetics data, and random cluster sizes are discussed. In addition, asymptotic normality of estimates based on all possible outputations, as well as a finite number of outputations, is proven given weak conditions. Multiple outputation provides a simple and broadly applicable method for analyzing clustered data. It is especially suited to settings where methods for clustered data are impractical, but can also be applied generally as a quick and simple tool.},

Contact tracing of named sexual and injection drug-use partners of people recently diagnosed with HIV is an indispensible tool for reconstructing this transmission network. Viral genetic sequence data—routinely collected by public health agencies—can also be used to infer the dynamics of HIV transmission. We analyzed partner naming and viral genetic sequence data in 1342 people living with HIV in New York City reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene between 2006 and 2012. Genetically linked partners were more likely to be named partners than named partners were to be genetically linked. This finding indicates that genetic sequence data are better than partner naming data for reconstructing this viral transmission network. Importantly, the success rate in naming a genetically linked partner varied by transmission risk category (e.g., men who have sex with men, heterosexuals, and injection drug users). This study validates the use viral genetic sequences in reconstructing these viral transmission networks in a public health surveillance setting.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic methods are being increasingly used to help understand the transmission dynamics of measurably evolving viruses, including HIV. Clusters of highly similar sequences are often observed, which appear to follow a 'power law' behaviour, with a small number of very large clusters. These clusters may help to identify subpopulations in an epidemic, and inform where intervention strategies should be implemented. However, clustering of samples does not necessarily imply the presence of a subpopulation with high transmission rates, as groups of closely related viruses can also occur due to non-epidemiological effects such as over-sampling. It is important to ensure that observed phylogenetic clustering reflects true heterogeneity in the transmitting population, and is not being driven by non-epidemiological effects. We quantify the effect of using a falsely identified 'transmission cluster' of sequences to estimate phylodynamic parameters including the effective population size and exponential growth rate. Our simulation studies show that taking the maximum size cluster to re-estimate parameters from trees simulated under a randomly mixing, constant population size coalescent process systematically underestimates the overall effective population size. In addition, the transmission cluster wrongly resembles an exponential or logistic growth model 95\% of the time. We also illustrate the consequences of false clusters in exponentially growing coalescent and birth-death trees, where again, the growth rate is skewed upwards. This has clear implications for identifying clusters in large viral databases, where a false cluster could result in wasted intervention resources.},

	abstract = {For infectious diseases, a genetic cluster is a group of closely related infections that is usually interpreted as representing a recent outbreak of transmission. Genetic clustering methods are becoming increasingly popular for molecular epidemiology, especially in the context of HIV where there is now considerable interest in applying these methods to prioritize groups for public health resources such as pre-exposure prophylaxis. To date, genetic clustering has generally been performed with ad hoc algorithms, only some of which have since been encoded and distributed as free software. These algorithms have seldom been validated on simulated data where clusters are known, and their interpretation and similarities are not transparent to users outside of the field. Here, I provide a brief overview on the development and inter-relationships of genetic clustering methods, and an evaluation of six methods on data simulated under an epidemic model in a risk-structured population. The simulation analysis demonstrates that the majority of clustering methods are systematically biased to detect variation in sampling rates among subpopulations, not variation in transmission rates. I discuss these results in the context of previous work and the implications for public health applications of genetic clustering.},

	abstract = {Background Transmission patterns of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) could relate to the structure of the underlying sexual contact network, whose features are therefore of interest to clinicians. Conventionally, we represent sexual contacts in a population with a graph, that can reveal the existence of communities. Phylogenetic methods help infer the history of an epidemic and incidentally, may help detecting communities. In particular, phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) have revealed the existence of large transmission clusters, possibly resulting from within-community transmissions. Past studies have explored the association between contact networks and phylogenies, including transmission clusters, producing conflicting conclusions about whether network features significantly affect observed transmission history. As far as we know however, none of them thoroughly investigated the role of communities, defined with respect to the network graph, in the observation of clusters.   Methods The present study investigates, through simulations, community detection from phylogenies. We simulate a large number of epidemics over both unweighted and weighted, undirected random interconnected-islands networks, with islands corresponding to communities. We use weighting to modulate distance between islands. We translate each epidemic into a phylogeny, that lets us partition our samples of infected subjects into transmission clusters, based on several common definitions from the literature. We measure similarity between subjects’ island membership indices and transmission cluster membership indices with the adjusted Rand index.   Results and Conclusion Analyses reveal modest mean correspondence between communities in graphs and phylogenetic transmission clusters. We conclude that common methods often have limited success in detecting contact network communities from phylogenies. The rarely-fulfilled requirement that network communities correspond to clades in the phylogeny is their main drawback. Understanding the link between transmission clusters and communities in sexual contact networks could help inform policymaking to curb HIV incidence in MSMs.},

We review current and emerging methods for collecting HIV-related network data, as well as modelling frameworks commonly used to infer network parameters and map potential HIV transmission pathways within the network. We discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of existing methods and models, and we propose a research agenda for advancing network analysis in HIV epidemiology.

However, it also has the more fundamental weakness of failing to balance different kinds of misdiagnoses effectively. This is not merely an aspect of the inevitable arbitrariness in choosing a performance measure, but is a core property of the way the AUC is defined.

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing has yet to be widely adopted for HIV. The difficulty of accurately reconstructing the consensus sequence of a quasispecies from reads (short fragments of DNA) in the presence of rapid between- and within-host evolution may have been a deterrent. In particular, mapping (aligning) reads to a reference sequence leads to biased loss of information; this bias can distort epidemiological and evolutionary conclusions. De novo assembly avoids this bias by effectively aligning the reads to themselves, producing a set of sequences called contigs. However contigs provide only a partial summary of the reads, misassembly may result in their having an incorrect structure, and no information is available at parts of the genome where contigs could not be assembled. To address these problems we developed the tool 'shiver' to preprocess reads for quality and contamination, then map them to a reference tailored to the sample using corrected contigs supplemented with existing references sequences. Run with two commands per sample, it can easily be used for large heterogeneous data sets. We use shiver to reconstruct the consensus sequence and minority variant information from paired-end short read data produced with the Illumina platform, for 65 existing publicly available samples and 50 new samples. We show the systematic superiority of mapping to shiver's constructed reference over mapping the same reads to the standard reference HXB2: an average of 29 bases per sample are called differently, of which 98.5\% are supported by higher coverage. We also provide a practical guide to working with imperfect contigs.},

	abstract = {Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation {\textgreater} 90\%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.},

	abstract = {Background: This paper introduces a method to estimate HIV incidence in Brazil using surveillance data. The interest is to estimate the annual lag (time from infection to reporting) distribution among incident cases in a given year with observations arising from a right truncated version of the distribution. Methods: For each treatment-naïve HIV case aged 15 years and over reported from 2004 to 2015 we estimated the time since infection based on a statistical model that relates the first CD4 count to time since infection. Under the assumption the lag distribution is expressed by a logistic probability distribution, we estimated HIV incidence as the upper limiting value of the logistic function. Since this approach requires at least eight observations per year, to estimate HIV incidence in recent years (2009-2013), we used linear regression models to estimate the missing observations for these years due to truncation in 2015. Using this approach, HIV incidence was estimated from 2004 to 2013, separately for males and females. Results: In 2013, HIV incidence among people aged 15 years and over was estimated to be 44827 (95\% CI 41143-47987), 32459 men (95\% CI: 29775-34642) and 12368 women (95\% CI: 11368-13345). Results from 2004- 2013 have shown an increase among men and a slow decrease among women. The estimated proportion of cases reported less than one year after infection increased from 24.6\% to 35.2\%, among men, and from 35.1\% to 45.8\%, among women. For men who became infected from 2004 to 2013, 35.6\% of the cases were not reported by year 2015 and among women, 23.2\%. Conclusion: The delay between HIV infection and diagnosis is of concern. Designing interventions to motivate testing is essential, especially among most-at-risk groups, as the faster HIV infected cases are linked to care, the faster the HIV incidence curve will turn downward.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify biological factors associated with HIV transmission in men who have sex with men (MSM).
DESIGN: A longitudinal phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 from an MSM cohort, incorporating clinical and epidemiological data.
METHODS: Potential individuals were HIV-infected MSM attending a sexual health clinic between 2000 and 2006. Individuals were classified such that they could move from recent to chronic infection categories. HIV-1pol gene sequences were obtained from plasma virus or proviral DNA and clusters estimated by maximum likelihood and conservative genetic distance differences. The single most likely transmitter generating each recent infection was ascertained and risk factors around time of likely transmission explored using Poisson regression modelling.
RESULTS: Out of 1144 HIV-infected MSM, pol sequence data were obtained for 859 (75\%); 159 out of 859 (19\%) were recently HIV infected at diagnosis. A single most likely transmitter was identified for 41 out of 159 (26\%), of which 11 were recently infected (27\%) and 30 chronically infected. Factors associated with transmission in multivariable analysis were: younger age \{rate ratio per 5 years older 0.68 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.86], P=0.0009\}, higher viral load [rate ratio per log higher 1.61 (95\% CI 1.15-2.25), P=0.005], recent infection [rate ratio 3.88 (95\% CI 1.76-8.55), P=0.0008] and recent sexually transmitted disease [rate ratio 5.32 (95\% CI 2.51-11.29), P=0.0001]. HAART was highly protective in a univariable model, RR 0.14 (95\% CI 0.07-0.27, P=0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Onward transmission of HIV among MSM is significantly associated with recent infection, sexually transmitted diseases and higher viral load, and reduced by effective HAART. The majority of new infections appear to occur from individuals whose infection was undiagnosed at the time of transmission.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Over the past few years, epidemiological models for infectious diseases have incorporated network structure: each individual has a set of contacts to whom they can pass the infection. However, collecting data to develop a good representation of the network is very challenging. The increasing availability of sequence data provide additional information: previous work has shown that it is possible to recover social network features from viral phylogenies. Until now, however, it was assumed that within-host evolution is negligible in the reconstruction. Here, we propose an approach based on approximate Bayesian computation to infer network structure from a virus phylogeny, explicitly including a model for within-host evolution. In addition, we incorporate other important heterogeneity factors such as individual-based transmission rates and infectivity varying by disease-stage. We show that in some situations the within-host virus diversity adds valuable signal to identify network structure, but in other situations it muddles the underlying contact structure.},

An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector–host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.},

The next-generation matrix (NGM) is the natural basis for the definition and calculation of ℛ0 where finitely many different categories of individuals are recognized. We clear up confusion that has been around in the literature concerning the construction of this matrix, specifically for the most frequently used so-called compartmental models. We present a detailed easy recipe for the construction of the NGM from basic ingredients derived directly from the specifications of the model. We show that two related matrices exist which we define to be the NGM with large domain and the NGM with small domain. The three matrices together reflect the range of possibilities encountered in the literature for the characterization of ℛ0. We show how they are connected and how their construction follows from the basic model ingredients, and establish that they have the same non-zero eigenvalues, the largest of which is the basic reproduction number ℛ0. Although we present formal recipes based on linear algebra, we encourage the construction of the NGM by way of direct epidemiological reasoning, using the clear interpretation of the elements of the NGM and of the model ingredients. We present a selection of examples as a practical guide to our methods. In the appendix we present an elementary but complete proof that ℛ0 defined as the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM for compartmental systems and the Malthusian parameter r, the real-time exponential growth rate in the early phase of an outbreak, are connected by the properties that ℛ0 {\textgreater} 1 if and only if r {\textgreater} 0, and ℛ0 = 1 if and only if r = 0.},

Based on the idea that computational scientists and engineers need, in both research and professional life, an understanding of theoretical concepts of mathematics in order to be able to propose research advances and innovative solutions, every concept is thoroughly introduced and is accompanied by its informal interpretation. Furthermore, most of the theorems included are first rigorously proved and then shown in practice by a numerical example. When appropriate, topics are presented also by means of pseudocodes, thus highlighting the computer implementation of algebraic theory. It is structured to be accessible to everybody, from students of pure mathematics who are approaching algebra for the first time to researchers and graduate students in applied sciences who need a theoretical manual of algebra to successfully perform their research. Most importantly, this book is designed to be ideal for both theoretical and practical minds and to offer to both alternative and complementary perspectives to study and understand linear algebra.},

Our approach combines genetic information from infection samples with epidemiological information of patient exposure to infection. While epidemiological information has been traditionally used to understand who infected whom in an outbreak, detailed genetic information is increasingly becoming available with the steady progress of sequencing technologies. However, many complications, if unaccounted for, can affect the accuracy with which the transmission history is reconstructed. SCOTTI efficiently accounts for several complications, in particular within-patient genetic variation of the infectious organism, and non-sampled patients (such as asymptomatic patients).

	abstract = {Understanding how changes in antibiotic consumption affect the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is important for public health. In a number of bacterial species, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, the prevalence of resistance has remained relatively stable despite prolonged selection pressure from antibiotics. The evolutionary processes allowing the robust coexistence of antibiotic sensitive and resistant strains are not fully understood. While allelic diversity can be maintained at a locus by direct balancing selection, there is no evidence for such selection acting in the case of resistance. In this work, we propose a mechanism for maintaining coexistence at the resistance locus: linkage to a second locus that is under balancing selection and that modulates the fitness effect of resistance. We show that duration of carriage plays such a role, with long duration of carriage increasing the fitness advantage gained from resistance. We therefore predict that resistance will be more common in strains with a long duration of carriage and that mechanisms maintaining diversity in duration of carriage will also maintain diversity in antibiotic resistance. We test these predictions in S. pneumoniae and find that the duration of carriage of a serotype is indeed positively correlated with the prevalence of resistance in that serotype. These findings suggest heterogeneity in duration of carriage is a partial explanation for the coexistence of sensitive and resistant strains and that factors determining bacterial duration of carriage will also affect the prevalence of resistance.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Currently available methods first estimate phylogenetic trees from sequence data, then estimate a transmission model conditional on these phylogenies. Outside limited classes of models, existing methods are unable to enforce logical consistency between the model of transmission and that underlying the phylogenetic reconstruction. Such conflicts in assumptions can lead to bias in the resulting inferences. Here, we develop a general, statistically efficient, plug-and-play method to jointly estimate both disease transmission and phylogeny using genetic data and, if desired, other epidemiological observations. This method explicitly connects the model of transmission and the model of phylogeny so as to avoid the aforementioned inconsistency. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through simulation and apply it to estimate stage-specific infectiousness in a subepidemic of HIV in Detroit, Michigan. In a supplement, we prove that our approach is a valid sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. While we focus on how these methods may be applied to population-level models of infectious disease, their scope is more general. These methods may be applied in other biological systems where one seeks to infer population dynamics from genetic sequences, and they may also find application for evolutionary models with phenotypic rather than genotypic data.},

	abstract = {Quantifying epidemiological dynamics is crucial for understanding and forecasting the spread of an epidemic. The coalescent and the birth-death model are used interchangeably to infer epidemiological parameters from the genealogical relationships of the pathogen population under study, which in turn are inferred from the pathogen genetic sequencing data. To compare the performance of these widely applied models, we performed a simulation study. We simulated phylogenetic trees under the constant rate birth-death model and the coalescent model with a deterministic exponentially growing infected population. For each tree, we re-estimated the epidemiological parameters using both a birth-death and a coalescent based method, implemented as an MCMC procedure in BEAST v2.0. In our analyses that estimate the growth rate of an epidemic based on simulated birth-death trees, the point estimates such as the maximum a posteriori/maximum likelihood estimates are not very different. However, the estimates of uncertainty are very different. The birth-death model had a higher coverage than the coalescent model, i.e. contained the true value in the highest posterior density (HPD) interval more often (2–13\% vs. 31–75\% error). The coverage of the coalescent decreases with decreasing basic reproductive ratio and increasing sampling probability of infecteds. We hypothesize that the biases in the coalescent are due to the assumption of deterministic rather than stochastic population size changes. Both methods performed reasonably well when analyzing trees simulated under the coalescent. The methods can also identify other key epidemiological parameters as long as one of the parameters is fixed to its true value. In summary, when using genetic data to estimate epidemic dynamics, our results suggest that the birth-death method will be less sensitive to population fluctuations of early outbreaks than the coalescent method that assumes a deterministic exponentially growing infected population., The control or prediction of an epidemic outbreak requires the quantification of the parameters of transmission and recovery. These parameters can be inferred from phylogenetic relationships among the pathogen strains isolated from infected individuals. The coalescent and the birth-death process are two mathematical models commonly used in such inferences. No benchmark on the performance of these models currently exists. We aimed to objectively compare two specific models, namely the constant rate birth-death model and the coalescent with a deterministic exponentially growing infected population. We compare coverage, accuracy, and precision with which they can capture the true epidemic growth rate parameter using simulated datasets. We find that the constant rate birth-death process can account for early stochasticity and is thus capable of recovering the epidemic growth rates more successfully. Provided one of the parameters is known, e.g. the sampling proportion of infected individuals, then the basic reproductive ratio can also be estimated reliably. We conclude that a birth-death-based method is generally a more reliable method than a deterministic coalescent-based method for epidemiological parameter inference from phylogenies representing epidemic outbreaks. Care should be taken if sampling is not constant through time or across individuals, such scenarios require so-called birth-death skyline models or multi-type birth-death models.},

We examine two popular approaches to this problem, the coalescent and the birth–death-sampling model (BDM), in the context of estimating population size and birth rates in a population growing exponentially according to the birth–death branching process. For sequences sampled at a single time, we found the coalescent and the BDM gave virtually indistinguishable results in terms of the growth rates and fraction of the population sampled, even when sampling from a small population. For sequences sampled at multiple time points, we find that the birth–death model estimators are subject to large bias if the sampling process is misspecified. Since BDMs incorporate a model of the sampling process, we show how much of the statistical power of BDMs arises from the sequence of sample times and not from the genealogical tree. This motivates the development of a new coalescent estimator, which is augmented with a model of the known sampling process and is potentially more precise than the coalescent that does not use sample time information.},

In 2011 the Incidence Assay Critical Path Working Group reviewed the current state of HIV incidence assays and helped to determine a critical path to the introduction of an HIV incidence assay. At that time the Consortium for Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays (CEPHIA) was formed to spur progress and raise standards among assay developers, scientists and laboratories involved in HIV incidence measurement and to structure and conduct a direct independent comparative evaluation of the performance of 10 existing HIV incidence assays, to be considered singly and in combinations as recent infection test algorithms. In this paper we report on a new framework for HIV incidence assay evaluation that has emerged from this effort over the past 5 years, which includes a preliminary target product profile for an incidence assay, a consensus around key performance metrics along with analytical tools and deployment of a standardized approach for incidence assay evaluation. The specimen panels for this evaluation have been collected in large volumes, characterized using a novel approach for infection dating rules and assembled into panels designed to assess the impact of important sources of measurement error with incidence assays such as viral subtype, elite host control of viraemia and antiretroviral treatment. We present the specific rationale for several of these innovations, and discuss important resources for assay developers and researchers that have recently become available. Finally, we summarize the key remaining steps on the path to development and implementation of reliable assays for monitoring HIV incidence at a population level.},

Various approaches have been employed for using longitudinal data to estimate the Mean Duration of Recent Infection (MDRI) – the average time in the ‘recent’ state. In this systematic benchmarking of MDRI estimation approaches, a simulation platform was used to measure accuracy and precision of over twenty approaches, in thirty scenarios capturing various study designs, subject behaviors and test dynamics that may be encountered in practice. Results highlight that assuming a single continuous sojourn in the ‘recent’ state can produce substantial bias. Simple interpolation provides useful MDRI estimates provided subjects are tested at regular intervals. Regression performs the best – while ‘random effects’ describe the subject-clustering in the data, regression models without random effects proved easy to implement, stable, and of similar accuracy in scenarios considered; robustness to parametric assumptions was improved by regressing ‘recent’/‘non-recent’ classifications rather than continuous biomarker readings. All approaches were vulnerable to incorrect assumptions about subjects’ (unobserved) infection times. Results provided show the relationships between MDRI estimation performance and the number of subjects, inter-visit intervals, missed visits, loss to follow-up, and aspects of biomarker signal and noise.},

	abstract = {Background
Transmission patterns of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) could relate to the structure of the underlying sexual contact network, whose features are therefore of interest to clinicians. Conventionally, we represent sexual contacts in a population with a graph, that can reveal the existence of communities. Phylogenetic methods help infer the history of an epidemic and incidentally, may help detecting communities. In particular, phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) have revealed the existence of large transmission clusters, possibly resulting from within-community transmissions. Past studies have explored the association between contact networks and phylogenies, including transmission clusters, producing conflicting conclusions about whether network features significantly affect observed transmission history. As far as we know however, none of them thoroughly investigated the role of communities, defined with respect to the network graph, in the observation of clusters.

Methods
The present study investigates, through simulations, community detection from phylogenies. We simulate a large number of epidemics over both unweighted and weighted, undirected random interconnected-islands networks, with islands corresponding to communities. We use weighting to modulate distance between islands. We translate each epidemic into a phylogeny, that lets us partition our samples of infected subjects into transmission clusters, based on several common definitions from the literature. We measure similarity between subjects’ island membership indices and transmission cluster membership indices with the adjusted Rand index.

Results and Conclusion
Analyses reveal modest mean correspondence between communities in graphs and phylogenetic transmission clusters. We conclude that common methods often have limited success in detecting contact network communities from phylogenies. The rarely-fulfilled requirement that network communities correspond to clades in the phylogeny is their main drawback. Understanding the link between transmission clusters and communities in sexual contact networks could help inform policymaking to curb HIV incidence in MSMs.},

While gathering data on host contact networks is very challenging, there is growing interest in using information about the pathogens themselves to understand transmission. In particular, as genomic sequencing becomes increasingly accessible, we have the opportunity to learn more about pathogen spread and evolution by constructing pathogen phylogenetic trees (phylogenies) from gene sequences. In this paper we aim to understand how networks of contacts between hosts affect the evolution of pathogens. This matter is complicated by the fact that contact networks can have large effects on how many infections there are, and the size of pathogen populations also affects their evolution. We designed an approach to simulate pathogen transmission and mutation over host contact networks and found that accounting for both the network's effects and population dynamic effects is necessary to use phylogenetic data to understand underlying patterns of host contacts.},

	abstract = {As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as transmission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed. We conclude with a short list of principles to guide the modelling response to future infectious disease outbreaks.},

	abstract = {There has been much recent speculation regarding the potential for HIV test-and-treat strategies to provide control of the HIV endemic. In the UK, despite advanced HIV surveillance and the implementation of a number of testing initiatives and attempts to widen access to antiretroviral drugs, the number of new diagnoses persists at a high level having risen considerably over the course of the last ten years. The extent to which this high level of diagnosis is attributable to levels of HIV transmission or improved rates of testing and diagnosis is unclear. To disentangle these competing factors, we use a Bayesian back-calculation based on HIV and AIDS diagnosis data augmented by observed CD4 count levels at diagnosis. The CD4 count acts as a prognostic marker indicative of the time-since-infection for any new diagnosis. In addition to estimating time-dependent rates of infection and diagnosis, we exploit the model structure to estimate posterior distributions for a number of key epidemiological quantities such as trends in the time-to-diagnosis and the time-since infection distributions as well as the prevalence of undiagnosed infection. These quantities are stratified by CD4 count where possible. The proposed methodology is applied to HIV/AIDS surveillance data from England \& Wales uncovering a decreasing trend in the time to diagnosis and stable levels of incidence in recent years.},

	abstract = {Background: Transmitted/founder viruses isolated at the early stage of infection are indicators of the variants that are spreading within a population. The French reporting system for new HIV diagnoses is linked to a virological surveillance using dried serum spots. Methods: Wecombined an immunoassay for very recent infection (less than 31 days) to a phylogenetic analysis of transmitted/founder viruses and sociodemographic information to analyze the dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic during a 3-year period. Bayesian coalescent-based methods were used to explore the temporal and spatial dynamics of the identified clusters. Results: Of 17 010 dried serum spots collected, 549 very recent infections were identified for which both env sequences and sociodemographic data were available. Non-B transmitted/founder viruses were found in 196 cases (35.7\%), belonging to six subtypes and seven circulating recombinant forms. Forty-three dyads/clusters were identified (range 2-11 cases), including 107 individuals (19.5\%), mainly MSM. The largest cluster involved MSM infected by a CRF02-AG variant. Reconstruction of viral migrations across time suggests that Paris was the major hub of dissemination. Conclusion: The study shows the feasibility of the surveillance of the HIV epidemic using this methodology. The observation of actively growing spatiotemporal clusters allows identification of specific networks that may be targets for intervention. © Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

	title = {Characterising {HIV} transmission risk factors in men who have sex with men using genetic source attribution and phylogenetic clustering},
	abstract = {Background: Phylogenetic clustering of random samples of HIV sequences can reveal epidemiological transmission patterns, but such analysis has limited theoretical support. Alternative source attribution methods provide unbiased estimates of the probability of each potential transmission pair. 

Methods: We analysed the first pol sequence obtained from 12164 treatment-naive patients diagnosed in London with HIV-1 subtype B and categorized as men who have sex with men. 
Phylogenies were analysed using both conventional distance and tree-based clustering methods using different threshold and source attribution methods which provide an estimate of the probability of each potential transmission pair. Linear and logistic regression models were used to describe trends in clustering and cluster size as a function of patient attributes including CD4, year of diagnosis and age. These analyses were repeated using the estimated number of transmissions attributable to each patient. 

Results: Both clustering and source attribution methods show very small but statistically significant effects of lower age and of higher CD4 at diagnosis on cluster size and attributable transmissions. Year of diagnosis is significantly associated both with cluster size and attributable transmission but in opposite direction: more recent diagnoses tend to belong to larger cluster but tend to have a smaller number of attributable transmissions.
Both approaches show strong assortative mixing between similar age groups and sampling periods but mixing patterns are different regarding CD4 stages at diagnosis.
The distribution of cluster sizes deviates greatly from the estimated number of attributable transmissions and the two quantities are weakly correlated.

Conclusions: While phylogenetic clustering is a fast and convenient tool for studying epidemiological transmission patterns, it has little theoretical support and may provide misleading results. Comparison to source attribution methods reveals some contrasting results that may indicate different transmission patterns.},
